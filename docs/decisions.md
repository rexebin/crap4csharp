# Design decisions — crap4csharp

Locked decisions for the C# port of `crap4java`. Source of truth alongside `docs/features/`.

## Product intent

- Analyze **C# projects** — the C# member of the `crap4*` family (`crap4clj` → `crap4java` →
  `crap4csharp`). Ecosystem: Roslyn (parse + complexity), Coverlet → Cobertura (coverage),
  `dotnet test` / MSBuild (driver).
- **Faithful 1:1 port** of `crap4java`: class decomposition, CRAP formula, CLI contract, report
  format, and exit codes preserved. Only the ecosystem adapters change.
- **Test fidelity:** every `crap4java` test gets a faithful C# counterpart with identical
  verification — except where an approved deliberate departure changes it.

## CRAP formula

Preserved verbatim from `crap4java`. For a method with cyclomatic complexity `CC` and coverage
fraction `coverage ∈ [0, 1]`:

- **Formula:** `CRAP = CC² · (1 − coverage)³ + CC`
- **Threshold:** a method is flagged **crappy** when `CRAP > 8.0`.

The formula and threshold are unchanged from `crap4java`; only `CC` is computed with the augmented
node set below (an approved departure), so absolute CRAP scores are not numerically comparable to
`crap4java` on code using the modern constructs.

## Locked choices

| Area | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Analysis target | C# projects | Roslyn + Coverlet/Cobertura + `dotnet test` |
| Namespace | `Microsoft.Crap4CSharp` | `AssemblyName`/`RootNamespace` = `Microsoft.<Project>` |
| TFM | `net10.0` | **SUPERSEDED at T31** — bumped from `net8.0`; see the **T31 register** |
| Parser | Roslyn (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`) | analog of the JDK compiler tree API |
| Coverage | Coverlet → **Cobertura** (line counters) | JaCoCo `INSTRUCTION` has no exact analog — absolute numbers differ, algorithm identical |
| Test framework | **xUnit** | + `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`, `coverlet.collector` |
| Assertions | **FluentAssertions 7.x**, pinned `[7.0.0,8.0.0)` | v8+ is commercial (Xceed); lock file enforces the pin |
| Coverage key | `TypeName#method#basename:line` — Roslyn enclosing-type **FQN** + method + source-file **basename** (T24, departure #12); `:line` stays LAST | C# allows many types per file **and** partial classes split one type across files, so overloads at overlapping min-lines collided; the FQN keys Cobertura, the basename segregates the per-file entries |
| Module root | nearest **`.sln`** (fallback `.csproj` → project root) | so `dotnet test` actually runs tests — **SUPERSEDED at T17 by departure #9 (Model B): the owning unit is the nearest `.csproj` (bounded); `.sln` is no longer a marker** |

> **CRAP magnitudes are NOT directly comparable to `crap4java`'s (T31b).** The CRAP *algorithm* is
> identical (`CC² · (1 − coverage)³ + CC`), but the coverage INPUT differs: coverlet counts **line /
> sequence points** (including brace-only and signature lines) whereas JaCoCo counts **instruction**
> coverage. The same logical code therefore yields a different absolute coverage %, and — since CRAP is a
> function of that % — a different CRAP **magnitude**. Do not compare a crap4csharp CRAP number to
> crap4java's on the same source; only the within-tool ranking and the `> 8` gate semantics carry across.

> **R1**.)

## Ratified conventions (Mr. Das)

- **C1 — Single production assembly.** All production code lives in one assembly, `src/Crap4CSharp`
  (mirrors `crap4java`'s single module). The pure core must not depend on the ecosystem adapters
  (Roslyn/Cobertura/process/git); this "core has no ecosystem dependencies" rule is enforced by
  **review and folder/namespace discipline**, not a compile-time project boundary. No
  Core/Adapters/Exe split unless Mr. Das later rules otherwise.
- **C2 — No underscores in member names (CA1707).** Analyzers run `latest-all` with
  warnings-as-errors in Release, so CA1707 is fatal on **all** member names — **including xUnit test
  methods** (e.g. `HarnessDiscoversAndRuns`, not `Method_State_Expected`). Parity tests preserve
  `crap4java`'s **behavior, not its names**; PascalCase-renaming a ported test is not a fidelity
  break.
  - **C2 clarification (T7 review; Bhaskar-verified build behavior).** CA1707 targets only
    **externally-visible** identifiers (public/protected) — which includes public xUnit test methods —
    so **private fields are outside its scope and build clean with or without a leading underscore**.
    The `.editorconfig` moreover *configures* `_camelCase` for private fields
    (`dotnet_naming_rule.private_members_with_underscore`) and deliberately disables StyleCop `SA1309`
    (the anti-underscore rule), so the **intended, build-safe form for a private field is `_camelCase`**
    (e.g. T9 `ComplexityWalker`'s complexity counter → `_complexity`). That naming rule is surfaced by
    IDE1006, which is not enforced during `dotnet build` (a known Roslyn limitation), so it is never a
    Release error either way — but `_camelCase` is both the configured style and future-proof. Net: C2's
    "no underscores … on **all** member names" governs the **CA1707 surface** (externally-visible
    members + public test methods), **not** private fields; do not avoid a private field for fear of a
    CA1707 conflict.

- **D-T8 — No `[Trait]` categorization (RESOLVED — Mr. Das ruled NO TRAITS).** crap4csharp adds **no**
  `[Trait]` attributes to its own tests; **all** crap4csharp tests are treated as unit tests, so the
  tight agentic dev loop runs them **by default** (the T6/T8 process/git integration-style tests run
  as-is). Full policy detail — "unit unless explicitly marked integration" + full-suite-needs-approval
  — lives in `README.md`. Closes the open **D-T8** decision; no `.github/skills/build-test.md` edit.

## Frozen reciprocal contract — `TypeName` canonical form (T9 ⇄ T10 ⇄ T11)

**FROZEN (T9 review, Anders).** The per-method coverage-lookup key `MethodDescriptor.TypeName` (the
"Coverage key" locked choice, elaborated) has exactly **one** canonical spelling that **both**
producers must emit byte-for-byte, so T11's exact-match keys align. This is **load-bearing**: any drift
on either side silently breaks coverage attribution (affected methods fall through to `N/A`).

- **Form:** dotted-namespace FQN of the enclosing type, then `.`, then the containing-type chain joined
  by `.` (outermost → innermost). **Each** type level that declares N type parameters carries a
  per-level backtick arity suffix `` `N `` (arity 0 ⇒ no suffix). A type in the **global namespace**
  yields the **bare** type chain (no leading `.`, no namespace prefix).
- **Canonical examples:** `Demo.Sample`; `Demo.Outer.Inner`; ``Demo.Container`1``;
  ``Demo.Outer`1.Inner`2``; bare `Sample` (global namespace).
- **Producer 1 — `CSharpMethodParser.TypeNameOf` (T9, emit):** builds it from the syntax tree
  (`BaseNamespaceDeclarationSyntax` ancestor chain + `TypeDeclarationSyntax` ancestor chain, per level
  `TypeParameterList.Parameters.Count`). **Pinned** by `CSharpMethodParserTests` — all five forms above.
- **Producer 2 — `CoberturaCoverageParser.NormalizeTypeName` (T10, produce):** must normalize the
  coverlet `class name=` attribute to this **same** form — nested separators (`/` or `+`) → `.`,
  **keep** the backtick arity, bare-ify the global namespace — and must be **pinned against a real
  coverlet sample** (R3). See watch-item **W-T9a**.
- **Consumer — `CrapAnalyzer` (T11):** builds coverage-map / method-lookup keys from this form. Do not
  change one producer without the other. **T11 discharged (Anders T11 review, 🟢)** — the consumer
  matches these keys byte-for-byte; pinned end-to-end by
  `ResolvesCoverageThroughFrozenReciprocalKeyEndToEnd`. See the **T11 register** below.
- **T10 discharged (Anders T10 review, 🟢).** Producer 2 now emits this form byte-for-byte:
  `NormalizeTypeName` = `rawClassName.Replace('/', '.').Replace('+', '.')` (backtick arity **kept**),
  pinned by `NormalizeTypeNameProducesFrozenReciprocalForm` (test 11, D-table) and by the real
  coverlet strings in `MatchesRealCoverletSampleClassNames` (test 10). See the **T10 register** below.

## T10 register — `CoberturaCoverageParser` (S3 close-out; Anders T10 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions, R3 closure, and watch-items from the final S3 task. `CoberturaCoverageParser`
is a faithful port of `JacocoCoverageParser` re-hosted on Coverlet→Cobertura per-method `<line>`
counters (departure #4). **No new behavioral departure beyond the already-approved set.**

- **D-T10a — behavioral XXE test replaces Java's white-box flag test (RESOLVED).** Java's
  `configuresSecureFactoryFeatures` inspected `DocumentBuilderFactory` feature flags; the C# port has
  no equivalent introspection seam, so the faithful counterpart is the **behavioral** test
  `DoesNotResolveExternalEntities` (N10): a canary file referenced through an internal-subset external
  entity via `file://` must never be read into the parse. Mechanism —
  `XmlReaderSettings { DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Ignore, XmlResolver = null }` — gives the
  **observably identical** guarantee (no external DTD/entity/XInclude is ever fetched). `Ignore` (not
  `Prohibit`) is deliberate: `XmlResolver = null` already blocks every external fetch, and `Ignore`
  keeps the DOCTYPE-tolerance test (`ParsesXmlWithDoctypeWithoutRequiringLocalDtdFile`) faithful while
  a malicious `&xxe;` reference still fails safely as an undeclared entity → wrapped
  `InvalidOperationException`, no file read/network/substitution. This is a **security/fidelity
  mechanism swap, NOT a new behavioral departure** — no departure number is assigned.

- **D-T10b — `NormalizeTypeName` keeps the backtick generic arity (RESOLVED).** The normalizer is the
  mechanical inverse of T9's `CSharpMethodParser.TypeNameOf`: nested separators (`/` or `+`) → `.`,
  per-level `` `N `` arity **kept untouched**, dotted namespace already emitted by coverlet, global
  namespace already bare. Discharged by `NormalizeTypeNameProducesFrozenReciprocalForm` (test 11, the
  full D-table) and by the real-sample forms in `MatchesRealCoverletSampleClassNames` (test 10:
  ``Sample.Outer`1/Inner`2`` → ``Sample.Outer`1.Inner`2``, ``Sample.Container`1`` kept).

- **R3 — real-coverlet normalization pin CLOSED for T10.** Final `NormalizeTypeName` rule:
  `rawClassName.Replace('/', '.').Replace('+', '.')` — nested `/` **and** `+` → `.`, keep per-level
  `` `N `` arity, global-namespace chain left bare. Pinned against a **real** coverlet Cobertura sample
  in test 10 (verbatim `class @name`/`method @name`/`<line>` strings), closing R3's "pin against a real
  coverlet sample" for the plain-FQN, nested, generic and compiler-generated forms. **Empirical note:**
  real coverlet emits nested-type separators as `/` (not `+`); `NormalizeTypeName` handles both, so the
  `+` branch is the defensive path for older tooling / the alternate spelling in the frozen contract.

**Watch-items (T10 review — visibility for Mr. Das; none blocks T10):**

- **W-T10a — async/iterator coverage-attribution gap (instance of R3).** Coverlet attributes an
  `async`/iterator method's body coverage to the synthetic state machine (`Outer+<M>d__N` / its
  `MoveNext`), which T10 skips (W-T9b/W-T10c). Since T9 emits the real `M`, such methods have no
  matching coverage entry and resolve to per-method `N/A` in T11 — consistent with departure #1
  ("per-method `N/A` unchanged"), **not a new departure**. Visibility: async-heavy targets will show
  more `N/A` than the Java tool would.
- **W-T10b — `get_`/`set_`/`add_`/`remove_` prefix-skip false-positive (rule 3).** A user method
  literally named `get_Foo` (with an underscore) would be wrongly skipped → `N/A`. Negligible
  probability; sanctioned by W-T9b. Logged.
- **W-T10b — RETIRED at T26 (append-only).** Departure #14 DELETES the `get_`/`set_`/`add_`/`remove_`
  Rule-3 accessor skip entirely (D-T26d), so nothing is skipped by name prefix anymore — a user method
  literally named `get_Foo` now emits like any other member. The false-positive this watch-item tracked
  can no longer occur. See the **T26 register** (D-T26a–g) and **departure #14**.
- **W-T10c — synthetic-`MoveNext` skip via containing class (ACCEPTED, ratified).** The skip predicate
  does **not** blanket-skip `MoveNext` by name; a synthetic `MoveNext` is caught by its angle-bracket
  state-machine class (rule 1), while a user-authored `IEnumerator.MoveNext` on a real class is kept and
  attributed (T9 emits it). This is the more-faithful reading of W-T9b's "skip *synthesized* members,"
  ratified as the accepted choice (not a departure); pinned both ways by
  `SkipsSyntheticStateMachineClassButKeepsRealMoveNext` (test 9).

## T11 register — `CrapAnalyzer` (S4 close-out; Anders T11 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and watch-items from the final analysis-composition task. `CrapAnalyzer` is a
faithful 1:1 port of `crap4java`'s `CrapAnalyzer` (`analyze`/`lookupCoverage`/`exactCoverage`/
`nearestCoverage`/`parseTrailingLine`) — the flat composition layer (Slice S4) that reads the changed
files itself and drives both parsers (T9 `CSharpMethodParser`, T10 `CoberturaCoverageParser`) itself,
exactly as the Java original does. **No new behavioral departure beyond the already-approved set #1–#7.**

- **Frozen reciprocal contract — CONSUMER end discharged (T11; key EXTENDED at T24).** `CrapAnalyzer`
  builds its exact/nearest lookup keys as
  `typeName + "#" + methodName + "#" + sourceFile + ":" + line` from `MethodDescriptor.TypeName`
  (T9) and `Path.GetFileName(file)` (T24, departure #12), and matches them byte-for-byte against T10's
  emitted map keys — the `#sourceFile` segment segregates per-file overloads of a partial class, and the
  trailing `":line"` is load-bearing (kept LAST so `ParseTrailingLine`'s last-`:` split and the
  nearest-line scan are unchanged; the earlier `":"` still stops `alpha` matching `alphaBeta`). Any drift
  on either producer silently collapses a method's coverage to `N/A`. Line formatting uses
  `InvariantCulture` (departure #3) so keys round-trip. Pinned end-to-end by
  `ResolvesCoverageThroughFrozenReciprocalKeyEndToEnd` (a nested generic ``Demo.Outer`1.Inner`2``
  resolving to a real 100%, not `N/A`) and by `SplitPartialClassOverloadsResolveToOwnFileCoverage`
  (T24). The T9⇄T10⇄T11 triad is now closed on all three ends.

- **D-T11a — `classNameFromSource` and the dead `projectRoot` param DROPPED (RESOLVED).** Java derived
  one `className` per file (`package` regex + filename); C# instead carries the per-method
  `MethodDescriptor.TypeName` (enclosing-type FQN, D-T9 / "coverage key = enclosing-type FQN"), so
  `classNameFromSource` has no C# analog and is dropped — its "no namespace ⇒ bare name" behaviour is
  already pinned by `CSharpMethodParserTests`' global-namespace form. Java's unused `projectRoot` param
  is dropped with it (behaviour-preserving). Java's `usesSimpleClassNameWhenSourceHasNoPackage` test has
  no C# counterpart (behaviour migrated to T9). **Not a new departure.**

- **D-T11b — nearest-line is the COMMON path in C# (visibility, not a change).** JaCoCo's
  `<method line>` equals the declaration line so Java's exact-match usually hits; T10 keys on
  `minChildLine` (first executable line, ≠ `StartLine`), so C# exact-match usually MISSES and the
  `exact→nearest→N/A` fallback resolves. The algorithm is faithful; only the branch hit-rate shifts.

**Watch-items (T11 review — visibility for Mr. Das; none blocks T11):**

- **W-T11a — tie-break relies on document-order enumeration (LOAD-BEARING invariant, not a departure).**
  `nearestCoverage`'s strict `<` makes the first entry in map-enumeration order win a distance tie. The
  production map is a `Dictionary<string, CoverageData>(StringComparer.Ordinal)` built by T10 in
  document order and **never mutated after build**, so .NET's insertion-order enumeration makes the
  tie-break **deterministic (document-order-first)** — the direct analog of Java's `LinkedHashMap`-pinned
  test, and strictly more deterministic than Java production's `HashMap`. Do **not** switch the map type,
  re-sort it, or remove keys, or this determinism breaks silently. Pinned by
  `NearestCoverageKeepsFirstEntryWhenDistancesTie`.
- **W-T11b — `ParseTrailingLine` (`int.TryParse` + `NumberStyles.Integer`) tolerates surrounding
  whitespace where Java `Integer.parseInt` would not — UNREACHABLE (T10 keys are pure ASCII digits).
  Negligible.**
- **W-T11c — a directory path in `changedFiles` is skipped by `File.Exists` (Java would
  `readString`-throw) — UNREACHABLE (dirs are expanded upstream, W12). Benign.**
- **W-T10a inheritance — async/iterator methods resolve to per-method `N/A` here (their coverage is
  attributed to synthetic state machines skipped by T9/T10). Consistent with departure #1; not a new
  departure. Expect more `N/A` rows on async-heavy targets.**

## T12 register — `CoverageRunner` + `CoverageReportLocator` (S4; Anders T12 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and load-bearing invariants from the coverage generate/locate task. `CoverageRunner`
is a faithful 1:1 port of `crap4java`'s `CoverageRunner` (delete-stale → run-once → throw-on-nonzero),
re-hosted on the `dotnet test --collect` pipeline; `CoverageReportLocator` is a C#-specific addition
with no Java counterpart (JaCoCo's report path was a fixed constant, so Java needed no locator).
**No new behavioral departure beyond the already-approved set #1–#8.**

- **D-T12b — the pre-resolved-`projectRoot` decoupling seam is LOAD-BEARING (do not break at S5/T17).**
  Both types take a **pre-resolved** `projectRoot` string and **never** call `ModuleRootResolver`; T14
  resolves the one module root once (departure #7) and injects the same string into
  `GenerateCoverage(root)` and `Locate(root)`. This is the seam the S5/T17 resolution-model swap
  (`.sln` vs `.csproj` vs hybrid) turns on: that swap must change **only** `ModuleRootResolver` —
  `CoverageRunner`/`CoverageReportLocator` stay untouched because they never learn *how* the root was
  found. Do not reintroduce a resolver call into either type.
  - **T17 amendment (Model B; ratified by Mr. Das, FLAG-9).** The S5/T17 swap did **not** stay confined
    to `ModuleRootResolver`: that type is retired/renamed to `OwningProjectResolver` and a new
    `TestProjectResolver` is added (departure #9), and `CoverageRunner.GenerateCoverage` gains a
    `testProject` token + explicit `coverageBaseDirectory` parameter (departures #9/#10). Only
    `CoverageReportLocator` stayed code-identical. Revised seam promise: **resolution + the runner's
    `dotnet test` target change; the locator and the `ResultsDirectoryName` reciprocal contract (D-T12e)
    are preserved.** The decoupling INTENT survives — coverage/locate still take a pre-resolved
    `_projectRoot` and never resolve on their own — but the "swap touches only `ModuleRootResolver`"
    letter is void.

- **D-T12e — `ResultsDirectoryName` is a frozen reciprocal contract (single source of truth).** The
  results-directory name `"coverage"` is declared **once** as `public const
  CoverageRunner.ResultsDirectoryName` and referenced by **both** the writer (`CoverageRunner`, which
  passes it to `--results-directory`) and the reader (`CoverageReportLocator`, which `Path.Combine`s it
  under `projectRoot`). Same lesson as the frozen `TypeName` contract: writer and reader must agree
  byte-for-byte or the locator silently finds nothing (a false fail-fast). Do not inline the literal
  `"coverage"` on either side and do not split it into two constants.

- **D-T12f — ordinal-first single-pick is a LOAD-BEARING determinism invariant.** **[SUPERSEDED at T22:
  `Locate` is replaced by `LocateAll` (surfaces ALL matching reports ordinal-sorted, no `FirstOrDefault`
  single-pick); >1 report now FAIL-FASTS (`multiple coverage reports`, exit 1 — our convention) instead
  of being silently single-picked. The timing-free / ordinal-sorted / pre-run-`coverage/`-delete facts
  below are retained as the list-ordering rationale for `LocateAll`. Body retained for audit.]**
  When more than one
  `coverage.cobertura.xml` exists, `Locate` returns the **ordinal-first** full path
  (`OrderBy(f => f, StringComparer.Ordinal).FirstOrDefault()`) — OS-independent and timing-free (no
  mtime/`LastWriteTime`; `CoverageRunner` deletes `coverage/` before every run, so every found file is
  fresh). Do not switch to timestamp/most-recent selection (reintroduces timing sensitivity) or a
  non-ordinal sort. The **multi-test-project fidelity reduction** this single-pick exposes (sibling
  test-projects' coverage silently dropped → per-method `N/A`) and the **single-token `--collect`
  spelling** were both ruled by Mr. Das to the contract's locked defaults — recorded as **departure
  #8**; multi-report aggregation is deferred to S5/T17 and revisited if S7 dogfooding hits a
  multi-test-project target.

- **No new departure from D-T12a/c/d.** The generate/locate split (D-T12a) preserves Java's
  `CoverageRunner` shape and keeps the locator independently testable; resolve-once/run-once (D-T12c) is
  departure #7; the coverage-command failure throws with the byte-identical message
  `"Coverage command failed with exit N"` (D-T12d) — originally the `IllegalStateException` →
  `InvalidOperationException` analog (C1, as in `CoberturaCoverageParser`), but **retyped at T15
  (ruling A) to the domain `CoverageException`** (message unchanged) so `Program.Main` could catch it
  specifically (D-T15b) — **broadened at T20** to a top-level `catch (Exception)`; `CoverageException`
  is retained and now caught by the broad catch, same anchor (see the T20 register). The T12/T14 fail-fast boundary is unchanged: T12
  **throws** on command failure (faithful) and **returns `null`** when the report is absent (the new
  locate signal); every exit-code decision (departure #1) stays in T14.

## T14 register — `CliApplication` + fail-fast gate (S4 close-out; Anders T14 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and load-bearing invariants from the composition/orchestration layer.
`CliApplication` is a faithful 1:1 port of `crap4java`'s `CliApplication`/`Main`
(`execute`/`parseArguments`/`filesForMode`/`explicitFiles`/`maxCrap`/`thresholdExceeded`) with the
`moduleRootFor` + `groupByModuleRoot`/`analyzeByModule` module-loop removed (departure #7). It composes
already-shipped types only — no resolution/coverage/parse internals of its own — so the S5/T17
resolution-model swap touches **only** `ModuleRootResolver` (D-T12b) [**superseded at T17: the swap
reshaped `CoverageRunner` and split resolution into `OwningProjectResolver` + `TestProjectResolver`
(departures #9/#10) — see the amended D-T12b and the T17 register**]. **No new behavioral departure
beyond the already-approved set #1–#8.**

- **D-T14a — the exit-code table is the canonical CLI contract (T14 owns every exit).** `Execute`
  returns exactly: **0** (`--help`; or no files → `"No C# files to analyze."` on stdout; or max
  CRAP ≤ 8.0), **1** (parse error `ArgumentException` → `ex.Message` on stderr + usage on stdout; or a
  fail-fast trigger; or a propagated exception realized at T15), **2** (`MaxCrap(metrics) > 8.0`, strict
  → `"CRAP threshold exceeded: {max:F1} > 8.0"` on stderr, `InvariantCulture`). This realizes
  departure #1 (exit 1 for fail-fast) and pins the exit-2 threshold path departure #1 did not
  enumerate. Do not move an exit decision out of T14.

- **D-T14b — three fail-fast triggers, greppable stderr anchors (departure #1).** All module/run-level;
  the per-method `N/A` path (a method absent from a *populated* report) stays in `CrapAnalyzer`,
  **unchanged**. (1) `CoverageReportLocator.Locate` returns `null` → anchor **`No coverage report was
  produced`** → exit 1. (2) `CoberturaCoverageParser.Parse(report).Count == 0` → anchor **`contained no
  coverage data`** → exit 1 — trigger 2 must inspect **`coverageMap.Count`, not the metrics** (a
  populated-but-non-matching report also yields all-`N/A` metrics yet must NOT fail-fast). (3)
  `CoverageRunner.GenerateCoverage` throws `CoverageException` → **propagates** (anchor **`Coverage
  command failed with exit`**), realized as exit 1 via `Program.Main`'s top-level `catch (Exception)`
  (broadened in T20; same `"Coverage command failed with exit"` anchor). Mr. Das ruled the trigger 1/2 wording to these defaults; tests
  assert only the bold anchor substring, so wording may re-tune without touching test structure.

- **D-T14c — double-parse LOCKED (option A); the `Analyze(map)` overload is DEFERRED.** T14 calls
  `CoberturaCoverageParser.Parse(report)` for the trigger-2 empty check, then
  `CrapAnalyzer.Analyze(filesToAnalyze, report)` re-parses the same small XML — negligible cost
  (dominated by the `dotnet test` run) and **zero API change** to a discharged T11 type
  (fidelity-first). Option B — add `CrapAnalyzer.Analyze(IReadOnlyList<string>,
  IReadOnlyDictionary<string, CoverageData>)` to share one parse — modifies a discharged API and is
  **Mr. Das's call**; deferred, not required for T14.

- **D-T14d — the T14/T15 propagation boundary (LOAD-BEARING for T15).** `Execute` does **not** catch
  the coverage-runner / parser throw (faithful to Java `execute … throws Exception`); it propagates.
  Java relied on the JVM exiting 1 on an uncaught exception, but **.NET does not guarantee exit 1 on an
  unhandled exception**, so T15's `Program.Main` **must** catch and convert to exit 1. This boundary was
  planned at T14 as a **bare `catch`** (the "D2" mechanism; Java has no coverage wrapper), but
  **superseded at T15 by ruling A** (see the T15 register / D-T15b): T15 instead throws the domain
  `CoverageException` and catches it **specifically** (`catch (CoverageException) → return 1`), realizing
  the **identical** observable behavior (full `ex` to stderr + exit 1) while keeping the entry-point
  catch least-privilege / CA1031-clean with **no** suppression. The load-bearing invariant is unchanged:
  `Execute` keeps propagating and `Program.Main` MUST catch to guarantee exit 1. (T15 shipped;
  `Program.cs` is no longer a stub.) **T20 addendum** — `Program.Main` is re-broadened to a top-level
  `catch (Exception)` catch-all under a scoped `[Program.cs]` CA1031 `.editorconfig` relaxation
  (justification-commented; no `#pragma`/`[SuppressMessage]`); the load-bearing invariant (`Execute`
  propagates; `Program.Main` catches → exit 1) is **preserved and generalized to all exceptions**, not
  just `CoverageException` — full Java `main throws Exception` parity.

- **Below the departure bar (no departure number, no ruling needed).** `MaxCrap`/`ThresholdExceeded`/
  `Usage` are housed on `CliApplication` (T14), not on `Program` (T15) as Java put `maxCrap`/`usage` on
  `Main` — avoids a composition→entry forward dependency and keeps T14 self-contained/testable; pure
  organization, behavior/tests unchanged. Java's pre-format `metrics.sort` is omitted because both
  `CrapAnalyzer` (T11) and `ReportFormatter` (T4) already apply the identical stable "scored desc, N/A
  last" sort and `MaxCrap` is order-free (behavior-preserving). The single-line trigger-1 message
  (avoids SA1118) is byte-identical to the fail-fast contract.

## T15 register — `Program` entry point + spawn integration tests (S4; Anders T15 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and load-bearing invariants from the entry-point task. `Program.Main` faithfully
ports crap4java's `Main.main` shape — resolve the project root, wire the real console streams + a real
`ProcessCommandExecutor`, delegate to `CliApplication.Execute`, and convert an escaping coverage-command
failure to exit 1 — while composition and exit ownership stay on `CliApplication` (D-T14b), so `Program`
adds no logic of its own. **No new behavioral departure beyond the already-approved set #1–#8.**

- **D-T15a — `Program` is a thin entry point only (no `Run` seam).** `Main` composes and delegates in a
  single expression; there is **no** intermediate `Run`/composition-root method, and
  `MaxCrap`/`Usage`/`ThresholdExceeded` stay on `CliApplication` (D-T14b), not on `Program` (where Java
  put `maxCrap`/`usage` on `Main`). This avoids a composition→orchestration forward dependency and keeps
  the S5/T17 resolution-model swap localized to the resolution seam (D-T12b) — at T17 that seam became
  `OwningProjectResolver` + `TestProjectResolver` (departure #9), no longer the single
  `ModuleRootResolver`; either way `Program` never learns how the root is found.

- **D-T15b — `CoverageException` + the specific `catch (CoverageException) → return 1` REALIZES and
  DISCHARGES the D-T14d boundary (LOAD-BEARING on both ends).** `CoverageRunner.GenerateCoverage` throws
  the domain `public sealed class CoverageException` (three standard ctors, **no** serialization ctor —
  the modern net8.0 CA1032 form; the legacy ctor is obsolete under `SYSLIB0051`), message byte-identical
  (`"Coverage command failed with exit N"`); `CliApplication.Execute` **keeps propagating** it (never
  catches); `Program.Main` catches it **specifically** and returns 1, writing the full `ex` (type +
  message + stack via `Console.Error.WriteLine(ex)`, ruling B) to stderr. This is what guarantees exit 1
  on .NET (which does **not** guarantee it for an unhandled exception), so **both** ends are load-bearing:
  `Execute` must not start catching, and `Program.Main` must not stop catching. The typed catch is
  CA1031-clean with **no** `.editorconfig` entry / suppression, **superseding the T14-planned bare
  `catch`** (D-T14d). **Superseded for `Program.cs` by T20** — `Program.Main` now uses a top-level
  `catch (Exception) → Console.Error.WriteLine(ex) → return 1`, licensed by a scoped `[Program.cs]`
  CA1031 `.editorconfig` relaxation (justification-commented; **no** `#pragma`/`[SuppressMessage]`).
  `CoverageException` is **retained** — `CoverageRunner` still throws it with the byte-identical
  `"Coverage command failed with exit N"` anchor, now caught by the broad catch (no behavioral loss, no
  message change). The load-bearing invariant is unchanged and generalized: `Execute` keeps propagating;
  `Program.Main` now converts **every** escaping exception (not just `CoverageException`) to exit 1 —
  full parity with Java `main throws Exception`. Mr. Das's register wording, verbatim: "introduce `CoverageException` to enable a
  least-privilege specific catch (CA1031-clean, no suppression); observable behavior unchanged (stderr +
  exit 1), so not a behavioral departure — **supersedes D2**." (Here "D2" = the T14-planned bare-catch
  mechanism recorded in D-T14d, **not** the feature-doc deferral "D2 = O2 subprocess timeout".)

- **D-T15c — `projectRoot = Path.GetFullPath(".")` (LOAD-BEARING for downstream path combines).** Mirrors
  Java `Path.of(".").toAbsolutePath().normalize()`: an absolute, normalized current directory. Every
  downstream combine/resolve (at T17 `OwningProjectResolver.ResolveOwningProjects` /
  `TestProjectResolver.ResolveTestProject`, formerly `ModuleRootResolver.Resolve`; the coverage results
  dir; explicit-file resolution) assumes an absolute normalized root, so this exact spelling is
  load-bearing — do not pass a bare `"."`.

- **D-T15d — spawn resolution: `dotnet <Microsoft.Crap4CSharp.dll>` via `AppContext.BaseDirectory`.** The
  app assembly is `Microsoft.Crap4CSharp.dll` (`Common.targets`:
  `AssemblyName=Microsoft.$(MSBuildProjectName)`), located next to the test assembly through
  `AppContext.BaseDirectory` — present at run time because the app is a **ProjectReference** of the test
  project, so its DLL is copied into the test output dir. The tests launch it **framework-dependent** as
  `dotnet <dll>`, **not** the OS apphost (`Microsoft.Crap4CSharp.exe` on Windows,
  extension-less/possibly non-executable after xcopy on Linux), so both spawn tests run uniformly on
  every CI OS (incl. ubuntu).

- **D-T15e — the two spawn tests must never reach a coverage run (fast/deterministic under D-T8).** Both
  ported crap4java `MainTest.mainProcess*` cases pick arguments that short-circuit **before**
  `CliApplication` reaches `CoverageRunner.GenerateCoverage`: `--help` → usage / exit 0; `--changed` + a
  file arg → parse error (`ArgumentException`) → stderr / exit 1. No real `dotnet test` is ever spawned,
  so the tests are fast and deterministic even though D-T8 runs them by default. The four remaining Java
  `MainTest` cases (#1/#4/#5/#6) are covered in-process by `CliApplicationTests` (a D-T14b relocation, not
  a reduction) — no fidelity loss.
  - **Below-threshold consequence of the least-privilege catch (no departure number, no ruling needed).**
    The specific `catch (CoverageException)` narrows the converted-to-exit-1 surface to the coverage-
    **command** failure. A `CoberturaCoverageParser.Parse` `InvalidOperationException` (malformed XML,
    D-T10a) would **not** be converted to a clean exit 1 — but `CoverageReportLocator.Locate` only ever
    surfaces a **real coverlet** report (well-formed by construction), so this path is **untested and
    practically unreachable**. It is a deliberate below-threshold consequence of the typed catch, **not**
    a new behavioral departure (the reachable observable behavior — stderr + exit 1 on a coverage-command
    failure — is unchanged from the bare-catch plan). **Resolved by T20** — the broad top-level
    `catch (Exception)` in `Program.Main` **does** convert these paths (malformed-XML / parser / git /
    I/O throws) to exit 1; the narrowing consequence no longer exists.

## T20 register — exit-code parity (S6 close-out; Anders T20 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and load-bearing invariants from the entry-point exit-code hardening. T20 broadens
`Program.Main`'s catch from the specific `catch (CoverageException)` (T15 / ruling A) to a top-level
`catch (Exception) → Console.Error.WriteLine(ex) → return 1`, licensed by a scoped `[Program.cs]`
CA1031 `.editorconfig` relaxation. **Not a new behavioral departure — it RESTORES Java parity**
(`main throws Exception`: the JVM already exits non-zero on any escaping exception; the pre-T20 escape
of a non-`CoverageException` throw as a platform-specific unhandled-exception code was the deviation).
Supersedes ruling A / D-T15b **for `Program.cs` only** (Mr. Das). **No new behavioral departure beyond
the already-approved set #1–#8.**

- **D-T20a — CLOSES the S6 clean-room "fatal exit-code consistency" finding.** Pre-T20 `Program.Main`
  caught **only** `CoverageException`, so a `git` failure (under `--changed`), an I/O error, or a
  malformed-coverage-XML / parser throw **escaped** and surfaced as a platform-specific
  unhandled-exception exit code instead of the documented `1`. The broad `catch (Exception)` converts
  **every** escaping exception to exit 1 (full exception — type + message + stack — to stderr via
  `Console.Error.WriteLine(ex)`, ruling B). `CoverageException` is **retained** — `CoverageRunner` still
  throws it with the byte-identical `"Coverage command failed with exit N"` anchor, now caught by the
  broad catch (no behavioral loss, no message change).

- **D-T20b — scoped `[Program.cs]` CA1031 relaxation (LOAD-BEARING; ratified convention).** T20 appends
  a trailing `[Program.cs]` section to `.editorconfig` — the **first single-filename (per-file) section
  in the repo**; every prior section is a glob/extension pattern (`[*]`, `[*.md]`, `[*.{cs,vb}]`, …) and
  the C# analyzer settings it overrides live in the global `[*.{cs,vb}]` block. EditorConfig has no
  CSS-style specificity — later matching sections win by **order**, so the trailing per-file section
  deterministically overrides the global block for the single `src/Crap4CSharp/Program.cs` (top-level
  statements are disabled, so no generated/duplicate `Program.cs` exists). The section carries a
  justification comment and sets `dotnet_diagnostic.CA1031.severity = none`. **Ratified convention:**
  license a legitimate, localized analyzer violation via a narrowly-scoped, commented `.editorconfig`
  section — **never** `#pragma` / `[SuppressMessage]`. This is the sole sanctioned catch-all; no other
  file is affected.

- **D-T20c — the exit-code matrix is reaffirmed (D-T14a still owns the 0/1/2 table).** `Program.Main`'s
  `try` returns `CliApplication.Execute(args)` **verbatim**; the `catch (Exception)` intercepts **only
  thrown** exceptions. Two invariants: **(I1)** no deliberate exit code is clobbered — every NORMAL
  RETURN (0 / 1 fail-fast / **2 threshold-exceeded**) flows through the `try` and is returned unchanged;
  **threshold-2 stays a normal return, never swallowed to 1**. **(I2)** every genuinely-thrown /
  propagated failure → 1 (pre-T20 only the `CoverageException` throw converted; now all THROWN paths —
  git / I/O / parser / coverage-command — convert). Pinned by the new spawn test
  `MainProcessExitsOneWhenGitFailsForChanged` (`--changed` in a hermetic non-git temp cwd →
  `ChangedFileDetector` throws `InvalidOperationException("git status failed: …")` → catch-all → exit 1;
  git isolation via `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` set once in the shared `RunEntryPointAsync` helper). The
  `Execute`-level exit-2 pin (`CliApplicationTests` #12 `ReturnsTwoWhenCrapThresholdExceeded`) is
  unchanged.

- **D-T20d — NOT a new departure (T20 adds no departure number).** T20 **restores** Java's
  `main throws Exception` "any failure → non-zero" contract rather than departing from it, so **T20**
  introduces **no** new departure number and makes **no** edit to departure #1 or its exit table
  (D-T14a). *(Historical note: at T20 the ledger stood at #1–#8. Departures **#9** (Model B resolution)
  and **#10** (unit-only target-test filter) were added by the later-executed **T17/S5** slice — a
  separate task — so the original "no departure #9 / #1–#8 untouched" wording refers to **T20's**
  contribution, not the final ledger; see the departures list and the T17 register.)* A future reader
  should **not** expect a departure entry for T20 — its reconciliation lives in the amended T14/T15
  registers (D-T14b / D-T14d / D-T15b / D-T15e) and this T20 register. **D-T15a preserved** —
  `Program` stays a thin, seam-less entry point (no `Run` method); the catch-all parity path is exercised
  end-to-end through the real entry point by the spawn test, needing no injection seam.

## T17 register — Module & test resolution finalization (Model B); S5 close-out (Anders T17 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and load-bearing invariants from the S5 resolution-finalization slice (executed after
S6/T20). Mr. Das ruled **Model B**: a bounded nearest-`.csproj` owning-project resolver plus a
`<Project>.Tests`/`.UnitTests` transitive-`ProjectReference` test-project resolver, running the ONE
resolved test project's **unit** tests. Adds departures **#9** (Model B resolution) and **#10**
(unit-only target-test filter); **supersedes #6**, **retires #8**, **keeps/reaffirms #7**. See those
departure entries for the behavioral contract; this register records the seam reshape, the rulings, and
the invariants.

- **D-T17a — the resolver split is a genuine SRP seam (Model B).** `OwningProjectResolver` (pure bounded
  FS walk → owning `.csproj` file paths) and `TestProjectResolver` (XML/graph parse of `ProjectReference`
  closures) are two focused static resolvers, orchestrated by `CliApplication.Execute` (which owns the
  resolve-once *policy* and every exit, D-T14a). Rejected: a single mega-resolver returning a record
  (hides two different concerns behind one API; the graph logic is harder to unit-test in isolation).

- **D-T17b — span policy = FAIL-FAST exit 1 (Mr. Das ruling; DECISION 1).** When the analyzed files
  resolve to **>1** distinct owning project, `Execute` fail-fasts with anchor **`span multiple
  projects`** (exit 1) — NOT an ordinal-first pick. Model B runs ONE test project per run; silently
  picking one owner would re-introduce the cross-project misattribution (project-B files scored against
  project-A coverage → all-`N/A` → inflated CRAP → possibly spurious exit 2) that departure #8 was
  retired to remove. The normal single-project baseline (R2/R6) yields exactly one owner in all three CLI
  modes, so this only bites multi-project trees, which the user must narrow.

- **D-T17c — append-only numbering (Mr. Das ruling; DECISION 2).** Departure **#9** is APPENDED; #6 is
  annotated **SUPERSEDED by #9**, #8 annotated **RETIRED/CLOSED by #9**, #7 **KEPT/reaffirmed** — all
  in-place bodies retained for audit, none rewritten. The prior T20 register's "no departure #9 / #1–#8
  untouched" wording is scoped to **T20's** contribution; #9/#10 are this slice's additions (D-T20d
  annotated accordingly).

- **D-T17d — unit-only target-test filter (departure #10; reverses the earlier stance).** The resolved
  target test project runs under `--filter "type!=IntegrationTests"` (exclusion form; untagged INCLUDED
  because VSTest treats an absent `type` as `!=` any value). `CoverageRunner.UnitTestFilter`
  (`private const`, never `internal`) is the single adjustable source of truth; narrowing to
  `{UnitTests, absent}` is the one-line append `&type!=Unit`. Mirrors mutate4csharp **minus** its
  mutation-cycle-only `Category!=no-mutate` clause (no crap4csharp analog — coverage runs once). Our
  fail-fasts are exit **1**, not mutate4csharp's **2**. Proven behaviorally by
  `CoverageFilterBehaviorTests` (real nested `dotnet test`), token-pinned by `CoverageRunnerTests`.

- **D-T17e — malformed-EXISTING `.csproj` treated as zero references (FLAG-1 resolution; Anders
  in-lane).** `TestProjectResolver.DirectProjectReferences` wraps `XDocument.Load` in
  `catch (XmlException) → return []`, so an existing-but-malformed `.csproj` in a name-matching
  candidate's transitive closure contributes zero references instead of throwing (`File.Exists` already
  guards the MISSING branch). This makes the type's own "missing/unparseable … skip, never throw" comment
  TRUE and matches the ratified non-throwing marker-probe discipline (`OwningProjectResolver`,
  `CoverageReportLocator`, `SourceFileFinder`); because `OrderBy` forces `ReferencesTransitively` over
  every name-matching candidate, this prevents a stray malformed candidate from aborting otherwise-
  successful speculative resolution. Scope: **`XmlException` only** (CA1031-clean, no suppression — the
  `[Program.cs]` CA1031 relaxation D-T20b does NOT extend here); genuine FS faults (`IOException`) still
  propagate to the T20 catch-all (exit 1). Pinned by
  `TreatsMalformedExistingCandidateAsZeroReferencesAndResolvesValidSibling`.

- **D-T17f — fail-fast triggers grow 2 → 4 (+1 span); new greppable anchors (departure #1; extends
  D-T14b).** `Execute` now fail-fasts on **`has no owning project`** (T27: anchor re-tuned from the
  original `No owning .csproj`, predicate generalized from all-files-unowned to ANY-file-unowned —
  finding #2; it absorbs the old no-owner trigger, strictly stronger, no net-new trigger; see the T27
  register D-T27a/b), **`span multiple projects`** (DECISION
  1), and **`No test project`** — all BEFORE any coverage run (assert the runner is not invoked) — then
  the two existing post-run triggers **`No coverage report was produced`** / **`contained no coverage
  data`**. The exit table (D-T14a) is structurally unchanged (0/1/2); resolution adds only new exit-1
  reasons. Tests assert the bold anchor substring, so wording may re-tune freely.

- **D-T17g — D-T12b/D-T14/D-T15a seam promise amended (FLAG-9 ratified).** The "S5/T17 swap touches only
  `ModuleRootResolver`" promise is **broken by design**: resolution split into
  `OwningProjectResolver` + `TestProjectResolver`, and `CoverageRunner.GenerateCoverage` gained a
  `testProject` token + `coverageBaseDirectory`. Only `CoverageReportLocator` stayed code-identical; the
  D-T12e `ResultsDirectoryName` reciprocal contract and coverage-base = `_projectRoot` are preserved. The
  decoupling INTENT survives (coverage/locate take a pre-resolved root and never resolve on their own).

- **D-T28c — Finding 7 (S6 re-run #3): `TestProjectResolver` MSBuild-property evaluation (RESOLVED at
  T29 → D-T29a).** `TestProjectResolver` resolves `ProjectReference` closures by RAW-XML parse
  (`XDocument`), so PRE-T29 a valid test project whose `ProjectReference` path used an MSBuild property
  (e.g. `$(RepoRoot)`, `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)`) failed transitive resolution → `Execute` fail-fasted
  with the clean `No test project` message (exit 1). Documented at T28 as an ACCEPTED, FAIL-SAFE limitation
  (no mis-scoring, no false pass; distinct from the D-T17e malformed-`.csproj` case, which is an XML fault).
  **RESOLVED at T29 (see D-T29a)** for the intrinsic ten + a bounded user-defined property set
  (`Directory.Build.props` ancestor chain + the csproj body). **Residuals (deferred, still FAIL-SAFE):**
  `.sln`-synthesized `$(SolutionDir)`, non-self-guard `Condition`s, property functions (`$([…]::…)`),
  item/metadata (`@(…)` / `%(…)`), env/global props (`$(Configuration)`, …), `<Import>` chains,
  `Directory.Build.targets` (auto-imported like `Directory.Build.props`, not via a literal `<Import>`), and
  `Directory.Build.props` files above the invocation root — each stays a VERBATIM `$(...)` token →
  non-existent path → dropped edge → closure misses → clean exit 1. (Placed in the T17 resolver register
  for context; authored at T28, updated at T29.)

- **D-T29a — Finding 7 fix (O2): bounded MSBuild-property evaluation before `ProjectReference` matching.**
  `TestProjectResolver` (now `public static partial`, hosting the `[GeneratedRegex]` methods per the
  `CoberturaCoverageParser` idiom; NO `internal`, NO NuGet, NO `Microsoft.Build.*` — BCL
  `System.Text.RegularExpressions` only) evaluates a bounded MSBuild-property set and expands `$(...)`
  tokens in each `ProjectReference Include` BEFORE the existing `.Replace('\\','/')` → `Path.Combine` →
  `Path.GetFullPath` tail (the sole insertion point, inside the `ReadProjectReferences` helper — which the
  memoized `DirectProjectReferences` calls — after `XDocument.Load` succeeds). No public-API change; NO
  static mutable state — a per-`ResolveTestProject`-call
  `ResolutionContext` (invocation root + a `ProjectReference`-closure memo) is threaded as a parameter. Two
  stages:
  - **Stage 1 — resolved property map (`name → value`) for csproj N.** Base = the **file-scoped intrinsic
    ten**: `MSBuildThisFile*` is scoped to the file that DEFINES the property being expanded (a specific
    `Directory.Build.props`, or N), while `MSBuildProject*` = N ALWAYS — this is exactly why
    `RepoRoot=$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)` in a repo-root `Directory.Build.props` resolves to the repo root,
    not N's dir. Load-bearing (pinned by tests): `MSBuildThisFileDirectory` carries a TRAILING separator;
    `MSBuildProjectDirectory` does NOT. User definitions are collected in MSBuild precedence order — the
    **`Directory.Build.props` chain from the outermost ancestor at/under the invocation root down to the
    nearest, then N's own `<PropertyGroup>`s** (csproj body overrides props files; last-writer-wins) — then
    fixpoint-expanded to terminal values (un-memoized DFS — the only memoization is the per-project
    resolved-reference list; base case = the file-scoped intrinsics; an in-progress set leaves
    cyclic/self-referential tokens VERBATIM; a depth cap of 64 is a belt-and-suspenders guard against a
    pathological deep linear chain). Deterministic — a pure function of
    the ordered map. N's intrinsics overlay the resolved map (intrinsics win).
  - **Stage 2 — one regex pass** (`[GeneratedRegex(@"\$\(([^)]+)\)")]`) over the raw `Include`: a known
    property name → its value; an UNKNOWN name → the token retained VERBATIM (`m.Value`). No fixpoint here
    (Stage 1 already drove props to terminal values).
  - **Condition rule:** a `Condition` on a `<PropertyGroup>` or property element is honored ONLY when it is
    exactly the self-emptiness guard `'$(X)'==''` naming the property's OWN name X (apply the def iff X is
    not yet set); EVERY other condition → the definition is SKIPPED (fail-safe). The reversed form
    `''=='$(X)'` is not matched.
  - **`$(SolutionDir)`: explicit-def ONLY** — no `.sln` walk/synthesis (honors departure #9's `.sln`
    retirement); an undefined `$(SolutionDir)` stays a documented fail-safe residual (→ verbatim → dropped).
  - **Property NAMES compare `OrdinalIgnoreCase`** (MSBuild semantics) — the ONLY `OrdinalIgnoreCase` in the
    resolver; all path VALUES, sets, sorts, and tie-breaks stay `StringComparer.Ordinal` (departure #3
    intact; called out in a code comment so it is not misread as a #3 regression).
  - **No-throw / fail-safe (non-negotiable):** every uncertain branch (undefined, unknown, non-self-guard
    condition, cyclic, self-referential, depth-capped, `$(SolutionDir)` without explicit def, property
    functions `$([…]::…)`, item/metadata `@(…)` / `%(…)`, env/global props) degrades to a VERBATIM `$(...)`
    token → non-existent path → dropped edge → clean exit 1; it NEVER throws, NEVER guesses a match, NEVER
    mis-scores. New I/O = the `Directory.Build.props` reads: each parse wraps `catch (XmlException) → []`
    EXACTLY like the D-T17e csproj discipline (a malformed props file contributes ZERO properties; valid
    siblings still apply; `XmlException` only — CA1031-clean, no suppression). Genuine FS faults
    (`IOException` / `UnauthorizedAccessException`) still PROPAGATE to the T20 `Program.Main` catch-all. The
    props walk is a fixed-filename parent chain (`File.Exists`, no glob) → no enumeration-order ambiguity.
    `ResolveTestProject` enumeration, `ReferencesTransitively` BFS, bin/obj exclusion, ordinal-first
    tie-break, and the cycle visited-set are UNCHANGED. Folds under departure #9 (no new departure number);
    see D-T28c for the residual list.

## T21 register — Async/iterator coverage attribution; S8 close-out (Anders T21 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and invariants for the S8 hardening slice (executed after S7 dogfood, which
empirically confirmed the blind spot on `../mutate4csharp`: three tested state-machine methods —
`CoberturaLineCoverageParser.ResolveAbsolutePaths` (iterator), `ProcessRunnerSupport.DrainAsync` and
`TimedProcessRun.DrainAsync` (async) — all reported `N/A` and escaped the exit-2 gate). Adds departure
**#11**; touches no other departure. See departure #11 for the behavioral contract; this register records
the design rulings.

- **D-T21a — attribute the `MoveNext` method ONLY, not the whole state-machine class (Anders design
  call; in-lane).** Coverlet records the user's async/iterator body's real executable lines on the state
  machine's `MoveNext`; the sibling synthetic members (`.ctor`, `SetStateMachine`, `IDisposable.Dispose`,
  `get_Current`, `Reset`, `GetEnumerator`) either carry no `<line>` or carry synthetic non-user lines
  that would pollute the covered/missed counts. Aggregating all methods in the class was REJECTED
  (pollution + double-count risk); reading only `MoveNext` is the faithful signal for R3. Minor accepted
  under-count: an iterator's `try/finally`/`using` teardown that coverlet places on `Dispose` is not
  folded in — negligible and consistent with "score the body."

- **D-T21b — class-level detection routes state machines AWAY from `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod` (surgical
  predicate flow; provably preserves R2/R3/R4 + lambda skip).** `Parse` classifies each `<class>` first:
  a nested last segment `<Method>d__N` (non-empty `Method`, `>` immediately followed by `d__`+digits) is
  handled by a new state-machine branch (read `MoveNext` -> attribute); EVERY other class still flows into
  the UNCHANGED `ReadClassMethods` -> `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod`, so Rule 1 still wholesale-skips the
  remaining angle-bracket classes (lambda display `<>c` / `<>c__DisplayClassN`), and Rules 2/3/4 (`b__`/
  `g__` display methods, accessors, ctors) are untouched. The empty-bracket check is what keeps lambda
  display classes skipped (finding #3 deferred). `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod`'s Rule-1 comment is updated
  to note state machines are now diverted upstream.

- **D-T21c — disambiguation via the existing exact->nearest lookup (no CrapAnalyzer change).** The source
  method's `StartLine` (declaration line, `m.GetLocation()`) never equals the MoveNext body min-line, so
  the attributed key resolves via `NearestCoverage`'s ordinal prefix scan — the SAME mechanism that
  already resolves regular overloads (W-T11a). Overloaded async/iterator methods emit multiple
  `EnclosingType#M:line` keys (distinct MoveNext min-lines) and pick the nearest to each declaration.
  Nested/generic enclosing types keep backtick arity via `NormalizeTypeName` (D-T10b). Residual: the
  pre-existing overloaded-by-adjacent-line ambiguity is unchanged (NOT worsened), and explicit-interface
  async/iterator methods (coverlet may mangle `<IFace.M>d__N`) may still miss -> `N/A` as today (no
  regression) — neither needs a Mr. Das decision.

- **D-T21d — two existing wholesale-skip tests RESHAPED; async + iterator attribution tests ADDED.**
  `SkipsSyntheticStateMachineClassButKeepsRealMoveNext` and `MatchesRealCoverletSampleClassNames` pinned
  the OLD "state machine skipped wholesale" behavior; both are reshaped to assert the state machine's
  MoveNext coverage is now attributed to the source-method key while synthetic siblings, accessors,
  ctors and lambda `b__`/display classes stay skipped. New parser + `CrapAnalyzer` tests pin a REAL
  coverlet `<M>d__N` sample (mirroring `DrainAsync`/`ResolveAbsolutePaths`): the source method reports
  REAL coverage (not `N/A`) and the correct CRAP (async CC 2 @ 70% -> 2.108; iterator CC 3 @ 70% ->
  3.243). A `<>c__DisplayClassN` regression guard asserts lambdas stay skipped.

- **D-T21e — finding #3 (lambdas/local functions) explicitly DEFERRED.** Lambda bodies (`<M>b__N`, hosted
  on `<>c`/`<>c__DisplayClassN`) and local functions (`<M>g__...|N`) still resolve to skipped coverage; a
  captured lambda whose lines coverlet inlines onto the outer method are already counted, but a
  display-class-hosted lambda's own coverage is not attributed. Out of scope for S8 (Mr. Das ruled
  surgical: `d__N` only). Flagged for a future slice if Mr. Das schedules it.

- **D-T21e — RESOLVED at T23 (finding #3 CLOSED; append-only).** T23's **departure #13** generalizes the
  T21 attribution to lambdas (`<M>b__N`), local functions (`<M>g__L|N`) and async-locals, so the
  finding-#3 gap DEFERRED above is now closed: a display-class-hosted lambda's / local function's own
  coverage IS attributed and UNIONed into its source method — its earlier SKIP behavior INVERTS to
  attribution. Departure #11's `d__N` async/iterator behavior is UNCHANGED; #13 only ADDS the other
  member shapes (no edit to #11's prose). See the **T23 register** (D-T23a–e) and **departure #13**.
- **D-T21e — UNAFFECTED by T26 (append-only clarifier).** Departure #14 deletes the coverage-parser
  Rule-3 ACCESSOR skip (D-T26d), NOT anything on the `<…>`-synthetic path: lambdas (`<M>b__N`), local
  functions (`<M>g__L|N`) and async-locals still route through the `^<([^<>]+)>[bg]__` demangler and
  UNION into their enclosing source method exactly as #13 established (a `get_`/`op_`/`add_` name never
  begins with `<`). An accessor/operator body that CONTAINS a lambda/local function still emits ONE
  descriptor for the member and attributes the inner synthetic via #13 — no double-count, no regression.
  See the **T26 register** (D-T26a–g) and **departure #14**.

## T22 register — locator surfaces all reports; multi-report refusal folds into departure #1

- **D-T22a — the `multiple coverage reports` refusal REALIZES/EXTENDS departure #1 (no new #12, no
  renumber of #1–#11).** A multi-TFM build that emits >1 `coverage.cobertura.xml` is a **fail-fast**,
  not a silent single-pick — mirroring the T17 `span multiple projects` precedent (departure #9: Mr.
  Das ruled FAIL-FAST, not ordinal-pick, to avoid re-introducing the cross-project misattribution
  departure #8 was retired to remove). This adds **no** new departure number and makes **no** edit to
  departures #1–#11 or the exit table (D-T14a); it folds under **departure #1**'s fail-fast family,
  whose triggers grow **5 → 6** — pre-run `No owning .csproj` / `span multiple projects` / `No test
  project`, post-run `No coverage report was produced` / `contained no coverage data`, and now the new
  post-run `multiple coverage reports`.
  - **T24 update (append-only; does NOT amend D-T22a's ruling above).** Departure **#12** IS introduced
    later (T24 — per-file coverage-key basename). This does **not** contradict "no new #12" above: that
    clause correctly declined to number the *multiple-reports refusal* (which stays folded under #1).
    #12 is an unrelated C#-specific coverage-key collision fix; it neither renumbers #1–#11 nor touches
    the fail-fast family. See the **T24 register** and departure **#12**.
- **D-T22b — `Locate` → `LocateAll` (locator surfaces ALL matches; CLI owns the exit).**
  `CoverageReportLocator.Locate` (a single ordinal-first `FirstOrDefault` pick) is replaced by
  `LocateAll`, which returns **every** discovered `coverage.cobertura.xml` **ordinal-sorted**
  (`StringComparer.Ordinal`, OS-independent per departure #3) with **no single-pick**. The
  select-or-refuse policy moves up to `CliApplication`, which owns every exit per **D-T14a**: 0 → the
  existing `No coverage report was produced` path, exactly 1 → proceed to parse, >1 → fail-fast.
  Consistent with departure #9 (the resolver surfaces the set; `Execute` owns the exit).
- **D-T22c — new greppable anchor `multiple coverage reports`, exit 1 (our convention).** When
  `LocateAll` returns >1 path, `CliApplication` writes the bold-anchor substring **`multiple coverage
  reports`** to stderr and exits **1** — our convention, NOT mutate4csharp's `2` (mirrors departures
  #1/#9). Fired after the coverage run, during report location. Tests assert the anchor substring, so
  surrounding wording may re-tune freely.

## T24 register — coverage-key collision; per-file basename segment (S9; Anders T24 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and watch-items from the final S9 attribution task. T24 is a **C#-specific**
enrichment with **no Java analog**: the frozen reciprocal key gains a source-file **basename** segment
so overloads (and, post-T23, compiler-generated members) of a **partial class split across files** stop
borrowing each other's coverage via the nearest-line lookup. Adds **departure #12** (the first new
departure number since #11); `NormalizeTypeName` and the frozen `TypeName` form are **unchanged**.

- **D-T24a — key format RULED by Mr. Das: `TypeName#method#basename:line`.** The key gains ONE new
  segment — `Path.GetFileName(<class filename>)` — inserted **between** `#method` and `:line`. Ruled
  over the signature-based alternative (`TypeName#method(sig):line`): the basename is what coverlet
  already emits per `<class filename=…>` and is the exact dimension a split partial class varies,
  whereas method signatures would also have to be threaded from Roslyn and normalized to coverlet's
  spelling (a second frozen contract). `:line` (the MIN `@number`) **stays LAST** so `ParseTrailingLine`'s
  last-`:` split and the reciprocal nearest-line scan are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **D-T24b — `NormalizeTypeName` and the frozen `TypeName` form are UNCHANGED (contract preserved).**
  The basename is a **new, separate** key segment, **not** part of `TypeName`, so the T9⇄T10⇄T11 frozen
  reciprocal `TypeName` contract (and its D-table pins) is untouched. `NormalizeTypeName` keeps emitting
  the same dotted-FQN-plus-arity form; only the surrounding key grows a `#basename` segment.
- **D-T24c — BOTH producers + the consumer thread the basename identically.** Producer 1
  `ReadClassMethods` and the T21 state-machine path `ReadStateMachineMoveNext` each read
  `Path.GetFileName(classElement filename)` **once per `<class>`** and emit `…#method#basename:line`; the
  consumer `CrapAnalyzer` computes `Path.GetFileName(file)` **once per source file** (every method parsed
  from that file shares it) and threads it through `LookupCoverage`/`ExactCoverage`/`NearestCoverage`.
  `Path.GetFileName` normalizes both `/`- and `\`-separated coverlet paths, so producer and consumer agree
  OS-independently (departure #3).
- **D-T24d — a missing/empty `filename` yields an unmatchable key (fail-safe to N/A, never
  mis-attribute).** If coverlet emits no `filename`, the producer basename is `""` → a `Type#method#:line`
  key that the consumer (which always has a real `Path.GetFileName(file)`) can never match → the method
  stays per-method `N/A` (departure #1 family), strictly SAFER than the pre-T24 silent cross-file borrow.
  No new exit-code behavior.
- **D-T24e — the T21 state-machine key ALSO gains the basename (kept in lockstep).** Departure #11's
  attribution key becomes `NormalizeTypeName(enclosing)#Method#basename:minMoveNextLine` in the same
  shape, so async/iterator attribution keeps matching post-T24. Departure #11's prose describes the
  pre-basename key and is read as superseded by this register (no #11 text edit — its behavior is
  unchanged; only the key literal grew a segment).
- **D-T24f — reciprocal-key parity suite RESHAPED; split-partial-class collision proof ADDED.** The
  FROZEN T10/T11 key-parity tests are re-pinned to the three-segment `TypeName#method#basename:line` form
  (exact + nearest); `SplitPartialClassOverloadsResolveToOwnFileCoverage` proves two `Demo.Widget.Render`
  overloads in `A.cs`/`B.cs` at overlapping min-lines resolve to their OWN file's coverage
  (A → 100%/CRAP 1.0, B → 0%/CRAP 6.0) instead of borrowing. Bhaskar re-verifies the entire attribution
  suite green.
- **D-T24g — residual same-basename-different-directory collision ACCEPTED (documented, not fixed).**
  The key carries the **basename only**, not the directory, so two partial-class files with the same
  basename in different directories (`Foo/Widget.cs` + `Bar/Widget.cs`) can still collide. Judged rare;
  fixing it would require threading a project-relative path coverlet does not always emit consistently.
  Logged as a watch-item; revisit only if a real target hits it.

## T23 register — compiler-generated member coverage attribution (S9; Anders T23 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions and residuals for the final S9 attribution task, which GENERALIZES T21. T23
attributes EVERY compiler-generated member — lambdas (`<M>b__N`), local functions (`<M>g__L|N`) and
async-locals (`<<M>g__...>d__N`) — to its enclosing SOURCE method and UNIONs it into that method's
coverage, closing finding #3 (never-invoked lambdas/local functions previously reported `N/A` and
escaped the exit-2 gate). Adds **departure #13**; departure #11's `d__N` async/iterator behavior is
UNCHANGED and its A2 direct-emit path (`ReadStateMachineMoveNext`) is byte-for-byte preserved. See
departure #13 for the behavioral contract; this register records the design rulings.

- **D-T23a — one demangler + A→B→C class-level precedence (surgical; generalizes D-T21b).** A new
  `SyntheticMemberNameRegex` (`^<([^<>]+)>[bg]__`) extracts the source method from a compiler-generated
  MEMBER name — `[^<>]+` is the first angle-bracket group, which a user method never contains. `Parse`
  routes each `<class>` by precedence: **A** a state machine (`TryParseStateMachine`), split into **A1**
  async-local (the inner name ITSELF demangles via the member regex → COLLECT its `MoveNext` against the
  outer method) or **A2** plain async/iterator (a bare inner `M` → the UNCHANGED T21
  `ReadStateMachineMoveNext` DIRECT-EMIT); **B** a lambda display class (`TryGetDisplayClassEnclosing` —
  last `/`|`+` segment starts with `<>c`) → COLLECT each `<M>b__`/`<M>g__` member; **C** a real class →
  `ReadClassMethods`, which now COLLECTS real-class-hosted `b__`/`g__` members before its skip predicate.
  Precedence is unambiguous: a plain `d__` has `inner="M"` (A2), an async-local `d__` has
  `inner="<M>g__L|N"` (A1), and a `<>c` never carries a `>d__N` tail so it can only reach B.

- **D-T23b — phase-2 nearest-body MERGE is a faithful disjoint-line UNION; same-file overloads preserved
  (C6).** Members are COLLECTED in phase 1 (document order) as `SyntheticContribution` carriers, then
  `MergeSyntheticContributions` folds each into the NEAREST existing `Type#SourceMethod#basename:*`
  entry (closest trailing line by `Math.Abs`, strict `<`, first-in-enumeration wins ties) — MIRRORING
  `CrapAnalyzer.NearestCoverage` / W-T11a — else CREATES one at the member's MinLine. Summing
  `(missed, covered)` is a set UNION, not a double-count: every physical source line is owned by exactly
  ONE coverlet `<method>`, so body and synthetic lines are DISJOINT. Because the anchor is nearest-line,
  a synthetic folds into ITS OWN overload's body span, so distinct same-file overloads are NEVER blended
  (C6 preserved). The inner scan is read-only and the map is mutated AFTER it, so the map is never
  enumerated while mutated. The producer keeps a producer-local `ParseTrailingLine` (it must NOT depend
  on the consumer `CrapAnalyzer`), mirroring the consumer's last-`:` semantics.

- **D-T23c — safety property: `filename` mismatch → safe `N/A`, never a false pass (D-T24d family).**
  Each member key carries the display-class / state-machine `filename` basename (T24). If that differs
  from the enclosing method's own source file, the UNIONed key never matches the consumer's
  `Type#method#Path.GetFileName(file):` prefix, so the method stays per-method `N/A` — a SAFE
  under-report even when the synthetic member is fully covered. Pinned by
  `DisplayClassWithMismatchedFilenameYieldsNAnotFalsePass`. Attribution can only ADD real coverage to the
  CORRECT method or fall to `N/A`; it can never fabricate a false pass. **Why strictly under-report:** the
  source method's OWN body coverage is matched by its OWN key regardless of the member-`filename` mismatch,
  so only the ADDITIVE synthetic contribution is dropped (or is a baseline departure-#1 absence) and
  effective CRAP can only RISE — the exit-2 gate only becomes MORE likely to fire. Contrast **D-T28a** /
  **#14 residual (b)**: there a producer/consumer NAME misalignment hid a member that WAS
  present-in-coverage, uncovered, and high-CC, LOWERING the max-CRAP the gate sees (LESS likely to fire) —
  the opposite, unsafe direction; that structural difference is why this mechanism is safe and the
  literal-indexer one was not.

- **D-T23d — skip-guard INVERSION (ordering change only; `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod` UNCHANGED).**
  `ReadClassMethods` now demangles a `b__`/`g__` member and COLLECTS it BEFORE the
  `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod` skip predicate, so a recognized member is UNIONed into its source method
  instead of dropped wholesale. The predicate body is untouched: Rule 1 (angle-bracket CLASS) is now
  effectively dead on the real-class path (every angle-bracket class is routed to A or B upstream), and
  Rule 2 (angle-bracket METHOD) now only catches a residual UNRECOGNIZED synthetic (neither `b__` nor
  `g__`). This is what closes finding #3: a never-invoked local function `<Compute>g__Validate|0_0` @ 0%
  now UNIONs onto `Compute` (CC 1 → CRAP 2.0) instead of being skipped to `N/A`.

- **D-T23e — two residuals, both safe-by-construction to `N/A` (no Mr. Das decision needed).**
  (1) **Nested-synthetic enclosing** — a lambda/local function nested inside another synthetic, whose
  split enclosing still carries a `<>c...` segment, demangles to a `NormalizeTypeName` that never matches
  a real Roslyn `TypeName`, so its key is unmatchable → safe `N/A`, never a mis-attribution.
  (2) **Inherited D-T24g** — T23 keys carry the basename only, so the same-basename-different-directory
  partial-class collision T24 accepted applies here too; judged rare, logged as a watch-item, revisit
  only if a real target hits it.

## T27 register — orphan/unowned-file fail-fast; folds into departure #1 (S10; Anders T27 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions for the S10 orphan fail-fast, closing capstone finding #2. Pre-T27, an analyzed `.cs`
with **no owning `.csproj`** within bounds was dropped from the owner set yet still analyzed against a
*surviving* project's coverage -> silent per-method `N/A` + exit 0 — the same silent cross-project
misattribution the span fail-fast (#9, D-T17b) exists to prevent, resurfacing at per-FILE granularity
below the project-span check. Mr. Das ruled **FAIL-FAST**: the resolver SURFACES the unowned files and
`CliApplication.Execute` refuses **exit 1**. This adds **NO new departure number** and makes **NO**
renumber of #1-#13 or edit to the exit table (D-T14a) — it realizes/extends **departure #1**'s fail-fast
family and refines **departure #9**'s resolver output, the same fold-under-#1 precedent as **D-T22a**
(the multi-report refusal). The ledger stays **#1-#13** (T27 is NOT #14; #14 remains reserved for the
still-GATED T26 executable-member work).

- **D-T27a — the resolver SURFACES unowned files; `Execute` OWNS the exit (extends #1, refines #9; no new
  number). CA1034 top-level-type adaptation folded in.** `OwningProjectResolver.ResolveOwningProjects`
  now returns `OwningProjectResolution(IReadOnlyList<string> OwningProjects, IReadOnlyList<string>
  UnownedFiles)` instead of a bare owner list: owners stay **distinct + ordinal-sorted**, unowned files
  are **preserved in upstream ordinal order** (the analyzed set is already distinct+sorted). The per-file
  `ResolveOwningProject` is **UNCHANGED** (still `string?`); only the aggregate return grows the second
  list. This mirrors the ratified surface-the-set / CLI-owns-the-exit seam (D-T17a, D-T22b): the resolver
  reports, `Execute` decides per D-T14a. **CA1034 adaptation (Dave, flagged — Anders: in-lane, ✅):**
  `OwningProjectResolution` is a **top-level `public readonly record struct`** in the resolver's file and
  namespace (`Microsoft.Crap4CSharp`), NOT a nested type — nesting a public type trips **CA1034**
  (do-not-nest-public-types) under warnings-as-errors. `public` is the correct least-privilege here
  (golden rule #9 satisfied — same-assembly `CliApplication` and the test project consume it; an
  `internal` DTO or a CA1034 suppression would both be worse); it is an immutable, invariant-free value
  carrier with no equality reliance, so record-struct semantics are safe and the nesting bought nothing.

- **D-T27b — anchor `has no owning project`, exit 1; the `count == 0` branch is now DEAD and removed;
  out-of-root-file edge folded in.** `Execute` gains, at the EXACT slot the old `owningProjects.Count ==
  0` branch occupied — **before** the span (`> 1`) check and **before** any coverage run (D-T17f pre-run
  ordering preserved) — `if (resolution.UnownedFiles.Count > 0)` -> stderr + **exit 1**, message *"An
  analyzed C# file has no owning project. These file(s) have no .csproj at or above them (searched up to
  the invocation root '{_projectRoot}'): {join}. Ensure every analyzed file lives inside a C# project."*
  Greppable anchor **`has no owning project`** (re-tuned from the old `No owning .csproj`; tests pin the
  substring, so wording stays free — D-T17f license); the message now NAMES the offending file(s), a
  diagnosis improvement over the old blanket text. The old `owningProjects.Count == 0` branch is
  **REMOVED as unreachable**: `OwningProjects` is empty IFF every analyzed file is unowned, which is a
  strict SUBSET of "any file unowned" and is therefore already caught by the earlier orphan gate (the
  empty-file-set case exits upstream), guaranteeing `OwningProjects` is non-empty past the gate and
  `owningProjects[0]` is safe. The new predicate is **strictly stronger** — the old branch fired only
  when ALL files were unowned, the new one fires when ANY file is — so the orphan gate **absorbs** the
  old no-owner trigger: one trigger generalized, **no net-new trigger** (D-T17f's "2 -> 4" count is
  unchanged). **Out-of-root-file edge (flagged):** a file OUTSIDE `_projectRoot` resolves to a null owner
  (`ResolveOwningProject`'s `IsWithin` bound returns null) -> surfaced as UNOWNED -> the same fail-fast,
  so a mixed run of in-root-owned + out-of-root files now refuses deterministically instead of dropping
  the stray file and scoring it all-`N/A`. No exit-table change (D-T14a 0/1/2 intact; a generalized
  exit-1 reason only). **Tests:** `ResolveOwningProjectsIgnoresFilesWithoutOwner` INVERTS to
  `ResolveOwningProjectsSurfacesFilesWithoutOwner` (asserts one owner AND one unowned); sibling resolver
  tests read `result.OwningProjects` and assert `UnownedFiles` empty; a new CLI
  `FailsFastWhenSomeFilesHaveNoOwningProject` (mixed owned + orphan -> exit 1, anchor + orphan filename on
  stderr, coverage runner NOT invoked). Bhaskar: build 0/0 Release, 156/156 green, exit-matrix intact.

## T26 register — executable-member decomposition; adds departure #14 (S10 capstone; Anders T26 review, 🟢)

Resolved decisions for the S10 capstone member-decomposition task, closing capstone finding #3: the T9
parser (`CSharpMethodParser`) emitted descriptors ONLY for `MethodDeclarationSyntax`, so every other
logic-bearing member — property/indexer accessors, user-defined operators, conversions, finalizers,
custom event accessors — got no metric row and silently escaped the exit-2 gate. Mr. Das ruled **MAXIMAL
scope** (Scope B + both extras: finalizers + custom event accessors) with **b-1 CLR-name passthrough**
keying. Adds **departure #14** (same class as #2/#11/#13); the frozen `TypeName#method#basename:line` key
and `NormalizeTypeName` are **UNCHANGED** and no exit-table row (D-T14a) moves. See departure #14 for the
behavioral contract; this register records the design rulings. Bhaskar: build 0/0 Release, 172/172 green,
frozen key byte-identical, exit-matrix + T21/T23 attribution untouched.

- **D-T26a — MAXIMAL member set; single document-order switch (RULED).** The emitted set = property/
  indexer accessors, user-defined operators, conversion operators, finalizers, and custom event
  accessors; **constructors OUT** (crap4java §8.1); **bodyless SKIP**. `Parse` replaces the single
  `OfType<MethodDeclarationSyntax>()` loop with ONE `root.DescendantNodes()` `switch` that handles each
  member kind at its own node visit, preserving document (depth-first pre-order) order — the ordered
  parser oracles depend on it. Accessors are emitted when their parent property/indexer/event node is
  visited: there is **no** `case AccessorDeclarationSyntax` and **no** `case EventFieldDeclarationSyntax`
  (either would double-count accessors / wrongly collect compiler-generated field-like-event add/remove).
  No member nests inside a method body, so nothing is revisited; a lambda/local function inside a member
  body is descended into and counted into that member's CC (departure #2, unchanged) and NEVER separately
  emitted — it stays the exclusive province of T23 coverage attribution (#13). No double-count, no
  overlap.

- **D-T26b — b-1 CLR-name passthrough; `TypeNameOf` widened (RULED).** `MethodDescriptor.Name` carries the
  **CLR method name** (`get_`/`set_`/`init`→`set_`/`add_`/`remove_`/`op_*`/`Finalize`) and is used in BOTH
  roles unchanged: the report `Method` column prints it, and the coverage-key `method` token IS it. An
  `init` accessor emits `set_<Id>` (init-only setters lower to a CLR `set_` method, which coverlet emits).
  The frozen key and `NormalizeTypeName` are untouched; `TypeNameOf` widens its parameter
  `MethodDeclarationSyntax`→`SyntaxNode` ONLY — the arity/nesting/global-namespace body is byte-identical,
  so the five pinned `TypeName` forms still hold (an accessor node's `.Ancestors()` walks past the
  accessor/property to the same enclosing type chain). Mr. Das accepted the CLR form in the report column.

- **D-T26c — body rules (RULED).** Block body → `ComplexityWalker.Count(Body)`; `=> e` →
  `Count(ExpressionBody)`; an expression-bodied property/indexer emits exactly ONE `get_<Id>`/`get_Item`
  row. Accessor StartLine is the **accessor's own** location, not the parent property's, so CLR-name
  families that legitimately repeat (two indexers → two `get_Item`; separated same-target conversions)
  stay nearest-line-disambiguable against coverlet's per-accessor `minChildLine`; single-row members use
  the member's decl start, matching the existing method path (decl start, body end). `ComplexityWalker`
  is **untouched**.

- **D-T26d — Rule-3 inversion (RULED); retires W-T10b.** `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod`'s
  `get_`/`set_`/`add_`/`remove_` accessor skip (old Rule 3) is DELETED; the constructor skip is kept and
  relabeled Rule 3 (`.ctor`/`.cctor` still excluded). `op_*` (all operators + `op_Implicit`/`op_Explicit`)
  and `Finalize` NEVER matched any skip rule, so they already flowed through `ReadClassMethods` — T26 adds
  NO special case for them, only the matching parser descriptors. No collision with the T23 `<…>`
  synthetic routing (none of `get_Foo`/`op_Addition`/`Finalize`/`add_Evt` begins with `<`, so the
  `^<([^<>]+)>[bg]__` demangler and the A/B state-machine/display-class routing are byte-for-byte intact).
  Harmless new orphans appear (auto-property `get_`/`set_`, field-like-event `add_`/`remove_` —
  compiler-generated bodies coverlet may emit with NO matching descriptor); each name is unique per type,
  so an orphan can never be mis-attributed. **Retires watch-item W-T10b** (a user method literally named
  `get_Foo` can no longer be wrongly skipped — nothing is skipped by accessor prefix anymore).

- **D-T26e — `op_UnsignedRightShift` INCLUDED; `op_Checked*` DEFERRED via skip (Anders design call,
  delegated).** `>>>` is one trivial, unambiguous token→name row
  (`GreaterThanGreaterThanGreaterThanToken` → `op_UnsignedRightShift`), included. A declaration whose
  `CheckedKeyword` is present emits NO descriptor (the operator/conversion cases guard on it). Rationale:
  C# requires every checked operator to be declared alongside its non-checked sibling, which IS scored, so
  the operator KIND is covered; emitting the base name for the checked form would put two same-CLR-name
  descriptors (`op_Addition` checked + unchecked) on one type and let nearest-line borrow the unchecked
  entry's coverage → a genuine false pass. Skipping the checked declaration removes that risk (its coverlet
  `op_Checked*` entry simply goes unused) and avoids depending on an `op_Checked*` spelling not
  compile-verifiable at design time. Reversible upgrade path recorded (a checked-name transform over the
  eligible set). This is the sub-decision Mr. Das delegated ("include or explicitly defer — your call, but
  state it"): **stated — `>>>` in, `checked` out (skip), upgradeable.**

- **D-T26f — safe residuals (documented; NO product choice, no Mr. Das decision needed). ⚠ (1) CORRECTED
  BY T28 — see D-T28a/D-T28b.** (1) **[The "never a false pass" claim was DISPROVEN; the LITERAL case is
  now RESOLVED by T28.]** A LITERAL `[IndexerName("X")]` indexer no longer degrades: the T28 parser emits
  `get_X`/`set_X` (coverlet's CLR spelling), so the reciprocal key ALIGNS and coverage round-trips into a
  real CRAP. The residual `N/A` is now narrow — (i) a NON-LITERAL `[IndexerName(<const>)]` argument (not
  statically readable) and (ii) explicit-interface members — and is NOT "never a false pass": an uncovered
  high-CC member in either case degrades to `N/A`, is skipped by `MaxCrap`, and ESCAPES the exit-2 gate (a
  false negative). (2) Explicit-interface members inherit the existing
  D-T21c `N/A` residual. (3) Genuinely-adjacent same-CLR-name conversions/indexers rely on basename +
  nearest-line and inherit the ACCEPTED overload-adjacency residual (D-T21c/D-T24g) — a best-effort
  cross-attribution WITHIN one CLR-name family, never a false pass across DISTINCT members. Inherits
  D-T24g (same-basename-different-directory). Phrasing precision (Anders §8, non-blocking): a "two
  same-CLR-name conversions → deterministic N/A" is not naturally producible (nearest-line always matches
  something within the name family), so the deterministic safe-`N/A` residual is now pinned via the
  NON-LITERAL `[IndexerName(<const>)]` fallback (T28 parser test) — the LITERAL `[IndexerName("X")]` edge
  is RESOLVED by T28 (test A3 was INVERTED to a real-CRAP gate round-trip) — and the separated case is
  proven to resolve correctly (test A2). A
  GUARANTEED `N/A` for adjacent same-name conversions (detect-and-force rather than best-effort) would be a
  NEW product choice — none taken; proceeding on the safe inherited residual per Mr. Das's "otherwise
  proceed."

- **D-T26g — test + style consequences.** Two coverage-parser skip tests are reshaped for the Rule-3
  inversion: `SkipsCompilerGeneratedAndAccessorMethods` → asserts `get_Value`/`set_Value`/`Real` present +
  `.ctor` absent (`HaveCount(3)`); `MatchesRealCoverletSampleClassNames` drops `get_` from its `NotContain`
  predicate and ADDS the expected `get_Item`/`get_Prop` keys. New tests: parser P1–P11 (+P5b) pin
  accessor/operator/conversion/finalizer/event descriptor emission + CC oracles and the bodyless skips;
  coverage C1 pins the accessor/operator/finalizer/event entries emit while `.ctor` stays skipped; analyzer
  A1–A3 pin the end-to-end `get_`/`op_` round-trip, separated same-name resolution, and the `[IndexerName]`
  case (A3 INVERTED by T28 → the literal rename now round-trips to a real CRAP and fires the gate; see
  D-T28a/D-T28b). No crap4java parity break (crap4java is method-only; a knowing C#-breadth departure, not a
  fidelity regression). **Two style-only deviations from the contract's illustrative C# (behavior
  identical, ✅):** the `ConversionOperatorDeclarationSyntax` case computes the name into a `string
  convName` local before calling `Emit(...)` (SA1117, vs the contract's inline ternary 4th arg), and the
  two new test files omit the blank line between the T26 header comment and `[Fact]` (SA1512/SA1513). Pure
  formatting; Bhaskar re-derived every oracle independently and matched.

- **D-T28d — Finding 5b (S6 re-run #3): C# top-level statements unanalyzed (ACCEPTED narrow residual;
  documented at T28).** C# top-level statements (`GlobalStatementSyntax`) yield no `CSharpMethodParser`
  descriptor, so entry-point logic written that way is unanalyzed and escapes the exit-2 gate — the same
  CLASS as the T26/T27 no-descriptor gate-evasion, but FAIL-SAFE and narrow (one compiler-synthesized
  entry method, entry-point file only; every other real method in the program is still scored). ACCEPTED
  as a documented residual; not scheduled. (Placed in the T26 member-decomposition register for context;
  authored at T28.)

## T28 register — literal `[IndexerName]` gate-evasion fix; ledger correction (S11; S6 re-run #3)

Resolved decisions for the S11 first fast-follow — the third independent clean-room S6 eval (gpt-5.6-sol,
report-only), reconciled by Anders against the #1–#14 ledger (6/9 findings + all parity deltas already
ratified). Mr. Das ruled: FIX the literal `[IndexerName]` gate-evasion (finding #6) and CORRECT the
disproven "never a false pass" wording; explicit-interface members stay a documented residual. Entry map:
**D-T28a** the parser fix (literal-only scope + reversible upgrade path), **D-T28b** the ledger correction
+ test inversion, **D-T28c** Finding 7 (property-based `ProjectReference` — accepted limitation, T29
fast-follow; appended to the T17 resolver register), **D-T28d** Finding 5b (top-level statements — accepted
narrow residual; appended to the T26 register). No exit-table row (D-T14a) moves; the frozen reciprocal
`TypeName#method#basename:line` key is UNCHANGED. Build 0/0 Release, 176/176 unit green.

- **D-T28a — literal `[IndexerName]` gate-evasion fix (RULED by Mr. Das: fix the literal case; scope =
  literal only).** `CSharpMethodParser`'s indexer case hardcoded the CLR default base name `Item`
  (`get_Item`/`set_Item`), but coverlet emits the `[IndexerName]` CLR spelling (`get_X`/`set_X`), so the
  frozen reciprocal key never matched → per-member `N/A`. An uncovered high-CC such indexer (evaluator
  probe: CC 9, 0% coverage, true CRAP = 9²·1 + 9 = **90.0**) therefore reported `N/A`, was skipped by
  `MaxCrap`, and FALSE-PASSED the exit-2 threshold gate. **Fix (syntax-only, no semantic model):** a new
  private `static string IndexerBaseName(IndexerDeclarationSyntax)` derives the base name from a LITERAL
  `[IndexerName("X")]` attribute — matched on its SIMPLE name so the qualified form
  `[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerName("X")]` is recognised — returning the string literal's
  `Token.ValueText`; BOTH the expression-bodied (`get_` + base) and accessor-list paths use it. It falls
  back to `Item` when the attribute is ABSENT or its argument is NON-LITERAL (a `const`/`nameof`, not
  statically readable). The frozen `TypeName#method#basename:line` key contract is UNCHANGED — the fix only
  aligns the parser's producer name with coverlet's. **Scope = LITERAL only.** Three `N/A` residuals remain
  documented: (i) non-literal `[IndexerName(<const>)]`, (ii) explicit-interface indexer members, and (iii)
  the **syntax-only attribute-identity** limit — the attribute is matched by SIMPLE name with no
  `SemanticModel`, so a FOREIGN `IndexerName`/`IndexerNameAttribute` type (a user type in another namespace)
  on a literal-arg indexer is FALSELY matched (parser derives `get_X` while the compiler kept `get_Item`),
  while an ALIASED BCL attribute (`using IN = System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerNameAttribute;
  [IN("X")]`) is MISSED (parser falls back to `Item` while the compiler renamed to `get_X`); both misalign
  the frozen key to the SAME per-member `N/A`, are pathological, and are unresolvable without a
  `SemanticModel` — consistent with the ratified syntax-only parser design.
  **Reversible upgrade path for (ii):** map an explicit-interface member to its real CLR spelling once a
  real coverlet sample pins it — the explicit-interface name mangling is not compile-verifiable at design
  time, so it is DEFERRED, not guessed.

- **D-T28b — ledger correction + test inversion.** The DISPROVEN "never a false pass" wording is corrected
  at **D-T26f(1)**, **D-T26g** (test-consequences note), and **#14 residual (b)**: the LITERAL
  `[IndexerName("X")]` case is RESOLVED (round-trips coverage); the residual `N/A` is restated narrowly for
  non-literal `[IndexerName(<const>)]` + explicit-interface members and flagged as a genuine gate-evasion
  (false negative) — an uncovered high-CC member there escapes the exit-2 gate, i.e. explicitly NOT "never
  a false pass." Tests: the old analyzer A3 (`RenamedIndexerDegradesToSafeNA`, which asserted null
  coverage/CRAP) is INVERTED to `RenamedIndexerRoundTripsCoverageAndFiresGate` — an uncovered CC-9
  `[System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IndexerName("Element")]` indexer scores CRAP 90.0, `MaxCrap` picks it
  up, and `ThresholdExceeded` fires (the load-bearing gate round-trip); a new
  `CoveredRenamedIndexerScoresRealCrap` (A4) pins the covered case (100% → CRAP 1.0); three new parser
  tests pin literal-rename → `get_X`/`set_X` (block + expression-bodied) and the non-literal fallback →
  `get_Item`/`set_Item`.

## T30 register — same-line-accessor coverlet-blind 0%-promotion; adds departure #15 (S12 differential-eval)

Resolved decisions for T30 — the S12 hardening slice. A one-time two-oracle differential experiment
(gpt-5.6-sol × claude-opus-4.8, each blindly authoring ~25 cases, cross-predicting, then capturing ground
truth), reconciled by JARVIS + Anders, surfaced and **empirically confirmed** a gate-evasion false-negative
— **coverlet #507**: coverlet is line-level and records only the FIRST accessor on a shared physical source
line, dropping the rest from the cobertura XML. So an **uncalled same-line SECOND accessor with CC ≥ 3**
renders `N/A`, is skipped by `MaxCrap`, and silently passes the exit-2 gate (confirmed via `gate_probe*.ps1`
for property `{get;set}` [expr & block], indexer get/set, and event add/remove; multi-line accessors,
finalizers, operators and standalone getters are all caught at real 0%). No coverlet config toggle exists.
Mr. Das ruled **option (vi)** — a same-line-accessor 0%-promotion **with the type-present guard INCLUDED**
— adding **departure #15** (same enrichment class as #2/#11/#13/#14). Entry map: **D-T30a** detection
(start-line collision, superset-safe), **D-T30b** `CoverletBlind` plumbing (descriptor field; `MethodMetrics`
unchanged), **D-T30c** promotion predicate + type-present guard, **D-T30d** tests + non-regression + accepted
false-fail. No exit-table row (D-T14a) moves; the frozen `TypeName#method#basename:line` key and
`NormalizeTypeName` are UNCHANGED. Build 0/0 Release, full suite green.

- **D-T30a — detection: start-line collision, superset-safe (syntax-only; no `SemanticModel`).** In
  `CSharpMethodParser.EmitAccessors`, an emitted (bodied) accessor is `CoverletBlind` **iff** its
  declaration **start line** equals the start line of an EARLIER accessor of the same member (first-on-line
  is never blind; the second+ sharing that line IS). Start line = `accessor.GetLocation()…StartLinePosition
  .Line + 1` — the accessor KEYWORD line, IDENTICAL to `Emit`'s `StartLine`, NOT the body end — so a
  same-line pair whose second body wraps over many lines is still blind, and a keyword on the next line is
  never blind however far the property spans. Computed by threading a `HashSet<int>` of start-lines seen so
  far while iterating `list.Accessors` in document order (`!seen.Add(startLine)`), so it is kind-agnostic
  (`get`/`set`/`init`/`add`/`remove`) and reverse-order-safe (a leading `set` makes a trailing same-line
  `get` blind). Auto/bodyless accessors hit `Emit`'s bodyless-skip and never become descriptors (C# forbids
  mixing auto + manual accessors, so every EMITTED accessor is bodied); single-accessor members
  (expression-bodied get-only property/indexer; every method/operator/conversion/finalizer) are never routed
  through `EmitAccessors`. The flag may safely be a **SUPERSET** of the true #507 collapse set: promotion
  (D-T30c) is separately gated on genuine absence, so an over-flag whose entry IS found never promotes.

- **D-T30b — `CoverletBlind` plumbing: descriptor field only; `MethodMetrics` UNCHANGED.** `MethodDescriptor`
  gains one trailing defaulted field `bool CoverletBlind = false` (the 2nd C#-only appended-last field after
  `TypeName`, same pattern — every existing 5-arg construction/consumer compiles untouched, and full-record
  equality keeps the non-accessor and separate-line tests passing at the defaulted `false`). `Emit` gains a
  trailing `bool coverletBlind = false` forwarded straight into the descriptor; **only `EmitAccessors`** ever
  passes a computed value — every other call site (`MethodDeclarationSyntax`, operators, conversions,
  destructor, expression-bodied property/indexer `get_`) defaults to `false`. `MethodMetrics` is deliberately
  **NOT** extended: the bit is a parser→analyzer signal consumed inside `Analyze` BEFORE the metric is built,
  by which point coverage is already a real `0.0`, so the output record needs no new field — the descriptor
  field is the single, desync-proof carrier (no parallel set to drift).

- **D-T30c — promotion predicate + type-present guard.** In `CrapAnalyzer.Analyze`, BETWEEN the
  `LookupCoverage` call and `CrapScore.Calculate`: `coverage is null && method.CoverletBlind &&
  EnclosingTypePresent(coverageMap, method.TypeName, sourceFile) → coverage = 0.0`. Ordering is inherent —
  `LookupCoverage` already encapsulates exact→nearest→null, so `coverage is null` means BOTH missed;
  promotion fires strictly after. The real `0.0` then flows through `CrapScore.Calculate` (→ CRAP =
  `CC²·(1−0)³ + CC`) into the output row and `MaxCrap`/gate, exactly like a natively-reported 0%.
  `EnclosingTypePresent` (new `private static`, least-privilege — no test calls it directly, exercised
  through `Analyze` like `ExactCoverage`) returns true iff `∃` map key `StartsWith(TypeName + "#", Ordinal)`
  **AND** `Contains("#" + basename + ":", Ordinal)`, where `basename` is the SAME in-scope
  `Path.GetFileName(file)` value `Analyze` uses to BUILD the frozen key (`TypeName#method#basename:line`,
  T24 / departure #12) — NOT a full path. The `#` after `TypeName` is the exact-type delimiter (so `Foo`
  never matches `FooBar#`/`Foo.Nested#`); `#basename:` bounds the basename segment. It runs ONLY for the rare
  blind-AND-absent descriptor, so an O(keys) scan is fine (no precompute — YAGNI). **Guard rationale:** the
  0% promotion ASSERTS "uninvoked within an INSTRUMENTED type"; the type-present signal is that evidence
  (keeps within W4's spirit — never fabricate 0% for a type we have no evidence was instrumented). It never
  weakens the fix — in every real escape the surviving FIRST accessor is present under the same
  `TypeName`+`basename`, so the guard is satisfied where it matters; it only suppresses the pathological
  enclosing-type-entirely-absent case (where `N/A` is correct).

- **D-T30d — tests, non-regression, accepted false-fail.** Parser units **P-b1..8** pin the blind flag via
  full-record equality (one-line expr/block, separate lines, keyword-share-with-body-wrap, indexer, event
  one-line + multi-line, reverse-order first-on-line-wins, expression-bodied get-only). Analyzer units
  **A-b1..5** exercise promotion through `Analyze` (the guard is private): absent-blind → promoted 0.0/CRAP
  20; non-blind absent → stays `N/A`; blind but enclosing-type absent → guard suppresses → `N/A`; present@0%
  → real value (promotion no-op); present & COVERED → real 100%/CRAP 4 (no spurious promotion). Integration
  smokes in `CliApplicationTests` (FakeExecutor, no real `dotnet test`, so fast-suite / non-timing-sensitive)
  cover one end-to-end exit-2 per empirically-confirmed escape shape (property block + expression setter,
  indexer setter, event `remove`), a multi-line-setter regression (non-blind → caught at real 0% → exit 2,
  promotion untouched), and a no-spurious-trip guard (CC 2 same-line second accessor → promoted 0% → CRAP 6
  ≤ 8 → exit 0). **Non-regression / blast radius:** methods/operators/conversions/finalizers are
  single-emission → never blind; multi-line accessors have distinct start lines → never blind; name-mangling
  residuals (explicit-interface, non-literal/foreign `[IndexerName]` — #14 residual (b) / D-T28a) and
  async/state-machine residuals are NOT line-collapse → NOT coverlet-blind → their ratified `N/A` is
  preserved exactly. **Accepted new false-FAIL (Mr. Das):** a COVERED same-line CC ≥ 3 second accessor is
  dropped by #507 regardless of hits → absent → promoted 0% → false exit 2. Accepted as fail-closed: it
  needs the same rare same-line + CC ≥ 3 construction as the escape it closes PLUS the accessor actually
  being tested, and it errs toward the gate firing. It is mechanically indistinguishable from the
  escape-closed case (the report omits the entry either way), so it is documented here rather than given a
  duplicate integration test; A-b5 pins the adjacent "entry present & covered → no spurious promotion" path.

## Deliberate departures from crap4java (approved by Mr. Das)

1. **Fail fast** — when a module produces no coverage / runs no tests, exit non-zero (`1`) with a
   greppable stderr message, instead of the Java warn + `N/A` + exit 0. Applies at the **module/run**
   level only; **per-method `N/A` is unchanged** (a method absent from a populated report still yields
   an `N/A` row).
2. **Richer cyclomatic complexity** — augmented Roslyn node set (below). CC is therefore **not
   numerically comparable** to `crap4java` on code using the modern constructs.
3. **Determinism/idiom** — nullable reference types enabled; `InvariantCulture` + explicit `"\n"` in
   the report; `StringComparer.Ordinal` sort in `SourceFileFinder` **in place of** Java's
   platform-dependent `Comparator.naturalOrder()` over `Path`, and the same `StringComparer.Ordinal`
   sort in `ChangedFileDetector` **in place of** Java's `Path::compareTo` (both case-insensitive on
   Windows, case-sensitive on Unix), so source-file discovery and changed-file order are identical
   across OSes. Below the behavioral-departure bar (the final report is keyed/sorted downstream, not by
   discovery order); logged here only as the determinism counterpart to the `InvariantCulture`/`"\n"`
   choices.
4. **Line-based coverage field names** — `CoverageData`'s counter fields are renamed from crap4java's
   `missedInstructions`/`coveredInstructions` to `MissedLines`/`CoveredLines` (and the record's doc
   comment reframed to match). This port's coverage adapter is Coverlet → **Cobertura line** counters,
   not JaCoCo `INSTRUCTION` counters, so "instruction" terminology has no referent here. This is the
   **naming counterpart** to the already-approved coverage-granularity change (risk **R1**; see the
   Coverage row under "## Locked choices") — **not** a new behavioral departure: the `CoveragePercent`
   algorithm is byte-identical modulo the rename, and observable metrics/CRAP outputs are unaffected.
5. **Exclude C# build output** — `SourceFileFinder` omits any file under a path segment named exactly
   `bin` or `obj` (case-sensitive, segment-exact, at **any** depth beneath `src`; `Robin`/`object` are
   kept). Java's Maven `src` tree never holds build output (that lives under `target/`), so the Java
   finder needed no such filter; in C#, `bin`/`obj` are the analog of `target/` and contain
   compiler-generated `.cs` (`GlobalUsings.g.cs`, `AssemblyInfo.cs`, `.AssemblyAttributes.cs`,
   source-generator output). This filter is **load-bearing**: crap4csharp itself runs `dotnet test`
   (T12), which populates `bin`/`obj`, so without it generated methods would enter the analysis set and
   skew CRAP. This is a **departure that affects the analysis set** (unlike #3), yet it is faithful to
   Java's *intent* (analyze human-authored `src`). It deliberately does **not** exclude checked-in
   generated files (`*.g.cs`/`*.Designer.cs`) that live under normal source folders — Java analyzed
   generated `.java` under `src` too, so broadening the filter would break parity.
6. **Module-root walk unbounded (B1)** — **[SUPERSEDED at T17 by departure #9 (Model B): the unbounded
   `.sln`-first directory walk is replaced by a BOUNDED nearest-`.csproj` owning-project resolver
   (`OwningProjectResolver`) that never climbs above the invocation root; `.sln` is no longer a marker.
   Body retained for audit.]** `ModuleRootResolver.Resolve(startDirectory)` takes a single
   start path (no `workspaceRoot`), climbs **unbounded** to the filesystem root, and falls back to the
   **starting directory** when no `.sln`/`.csproj` marker is found — in place of crap4java's
   `moduleRootFor(workspaceRoot, file)`, which bounds the climb to `workspaceRoot` and falls back to
   `workspaceRoot`. Faithful to Java's *intent* (find the nearest module root at/above the start); the
   bound is dropped because the C# CLI carries no separate Maven-style `workspaceRoot`, real C# trees
   carry a `.sln`/`.csproj` so the walk terminates early, and termination at the filesystem root is
   guaranteed either way. Marker precedence: nearest `.sln` → nearest `.csproj` → start dir. (Ruled by
   Mr. Das; T13 shipped as `e4d1329`, no rework.)

7. **Resolve-once (single module root per run)** — `crap4csharp` resolves **one** module root per run
   via the existing `ModuleRootResolver` and runs coverage **once** at that root, in place of crap4java
   §6's per-module grouping (`groupByModuleRoot`/`analyzeByModule` — "group by module … run coverage
   once per module group"). T11/T12/T14 therefore resolve once and run once — **no** module-group loop
   in `CliApplication`/`CrapAnalyzer`, and multi-`.sln` (multi-module) targets collapse to the single
   resolved root: a knowing fidelity reduction from crap4java §6. Rationale: multi-module analysis is
   uncommon, the C# baseline already assumes a single resolvable `.sln` (R2/R6), and resolve-once keeps
   the pipeline materially simpler. **Test-parity consequence:** crap4java's module-grouping tests
   **adapt to resolve-once (assert a single resolve + single coverage run) or drop** — Bhaskar/Dave
   apply this at T11/T12/T14; no group-loop tests are ported. (Ruled by Mr. Das; supersedes watch-item
   **W17**.)

8. **Single-pick coverage report (ordinal-first)** — **[RETIRED/CLOSED at T17 by departure #9 (Model B):
   one owning project → one test project → exactly one `coverage.cobertura.xml`, so the multi-report
   ordinal-first single-pick and its DEFERRED aggregation are no longer needed (not implemented, not
   deferred); at T22 `CoverageReportLocator.Locate` was replaced by `LocateAll`, which surfaces ALL
   matching `coverage.cobertura.xml` paths (ordinal-sorted, no single-pick), and `CliApplication`
   fail-fasts on more than one (multi-TFM) — so there is no `FirstOrDefault` single-pick left to be
   "harmless" about. Body retained for audit.]** `CoverageReportLocator`
   (T12) deterministically
   selects **one** `coverage.cobertura.xml` via an **ordinal-first single pick** over the discovered
   report paths, and hands that single file to `CoberturaCoverageParser.Parse` (T10). Root-cause
   mismatch: coverlet emits **one report per test project** (`dotnet test --collect` drops a
   `coverage.cobertura.xml` per test project under `TestResults/`), whereas JaCoCo emits a **single
   per-module aggregate** — there is no coverlet analog of that aggregate, so the port picks one report
   rather than reading a ready-made union. **Consequence (under-reporting):** on a multi-test-project
   solution, methods whose coverage lives in the **non-picked** reports have no matching entry in the
   chosen report and resolve to per-method `N/A` (T11) — consistent with departure #1's "per-method
   `N/A` unchanged" — which makes a genuinely-covered method score as if **0-covered** and thereby
   **inflates its CRAP**; every test project except the picked one is under-reported. This is the
   coverage-side counterpart of **departure #7** (resolve-once): one root → one coverage run → now **one
   report**, and it is faithful to the common single-test-project baseline the port already requires
   (R2/R6 — one test project referencing `coverlet.collector`, one resolvable `.sln`). The single
   deterministic pick — **no** configuration flags and **no** report-merging branch — is deliberately
   the same shape as T10's single-path `Parse`. **Mr. Das-approved; multi-report coverage AGGREGATION
   (unioning the per-test-project reports) is DEFERRED to S5/T17**, whose scope now also owns report
   aggregation so multi-test-project solutions stop under-reporting. (Ruled by Mr. Das.)

9. **Module & test resolution (Model B)** — replaces the retired departure #6 walk with two bounded,
   deterministic stages, both scoped to the invocation root `_projectRoot` and never climbing above it.
   **(i) Owning project** = the nearest `.csproj` **file** at or above each analyzed `.cs`, found by
   `OwningProjectResolver` (renamed/reshaped from `ModuleRootResolver`): a **bounded** upward walk that
   stops at the invocation root, fixing the S6 unbounded ancestor climb. `.sln` is **no longer a
   marker** — the owning unit in the .NET ecosystem is a `.csproj`. The distinct owning set across the
   analyzed files is reduced ordinal-first, and **departure #7 (resolve-once) is KEPT/reaffirmed**: a
   run resolves exactly ONE owning project. **(ii) Test project** = `<Project>.Tests.csproj` **or**
   `<Project>.UnitTests.csproj` whose `ProjectReference`s **transitively** include the owning project,
   found by the new `TestProjectResolver` (recursive `.csproj` scan under the root, `bin`/`obj` excluded
   per departure #5, cycle-safe transitive walk, ordinal-first tie-break, non-throwing on
   missing/malformed `.csproj`). **(T29:** #9's resolver now evaluates a bounded intrinsic + user-defined
   MSBuild property set — the file-scoped intrinsic ten plus the `Directory.Build.props` ancestor chain and
   the csproj body — before matching `ProjectReference` Includes, fail-safe throughout (any unevaluable
   token stays verbatim → dropped edge → clean exit 1); see D-T29a.**)** Coverage then runs **once** against
   that ONE test project, producing
   exactly ONE `coverage.cobertura.xml`. **New fail-fasts (exit 1 — our convention, NOT mutate4csharp's
   2; realizes departure #1), all fired BEFORE any coverage run:** `No owning .csproj` (no owner within
   bounds); `span multiple projects` (analyzed files resolve to >1 owning project — **Mr. Das ruled
   FAIL-FAST, not ordinal-pick**, to avoid re-introducing the silent cross-project misattribution
   departure #8 was retired to remove); `No test project` (no matching `.Tests`/`.UnitTests`
   transitively referencing the owner). **Load-bearing:** the `.Tests`/`.UnitTests` **naming-convention
   dependency** and **fail-fast-on-absence** are required for a target to be analyzable. **Supersedes
   departure #6** (unbounded `.sln`-first walk) and **retires/closes departure #8** (multi-report
   ordinal-first single-pick + deferred aggregation — one test project now means one report, so
   aggregation is neither implemented nor deferred). Ecosystem adaptation of crap4java §6 (Maven
   module-root `pom.xml` walk) plus mutate4csharp's owning-project + `.Tests` model; the knowing
   departure from crap4java parity on WHICH tests run is departure #10. (Ruled by Mr. Das: Model B;
   append #9; span → fail-fast; #6 superseded; #8 retired; #7 kept.)

10. **Unit-only test selection on analyzed targets** — the resolved target test project runs as
    `dotnet test <TestProject> --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --filter "type!=IntegrationTests"
    --results-directory coverage`, so **only the target's UNIT tests** produce coverage. A target test
    is a unit test unless it is tagged `[Trait("type", "IntegrationTests")]`; tests tagged `type` =
    `UnitTests` or `Unit`, **and untagged tests**, all run. The **exclusion form is mandatory and
    load-bearing:** VSTest treats an **absent** `type` property as satisfying `!=` any value, so
    **untagged target tests are INCLUDED** (an inclusion form such as `type=UnitTests` would WRONGLY
    drop untagged tests). The single adjustable source of truth is `private const
    CoverageRunner.UnitTestFilter` (least-privilege — never `internal`, golden rule #9); narrowing
    "unit" to strictly `{UnitTests, absent}` is the one-line, still-exclusion-form append
    `"type!=IntegrationTests&type!=Unit"` (untagged stays included). This **mirrors mutate4csharp**
    **minus** its mutation-cycle-only `Category!=no-mutate` clause — which excludes tests that
    recursively start `dotnet`/coverage per mutant run and has **no crap4csharp analog** (coverage runs
    once, no mutant loop), hence **out of scope**. **Knowing departure from crap4java parity:** crap4java
    ran **ALL** of a resolved module's tests (`mvn test`, no unit/integration split); #10 changes WHICH
    target tests execute (hence which coverage is produced), not crap4csharp's own analysis logic, and
    is faithful to intent (exercise the code unit under analysis with its unit tests). **Rationale
    correction (T31a; empirically confirmed — SOL-25):** an earlier draft of this clause claimed a
    pathological target whose entire suite is `type=IntegrationTests` "yields no coverage → the report
    fail-fasts fire." That is WRONG. Coverlet instruments the analyzed target **regardless of which tests
    match the `--filter`**, so even when the filter excludes every test the run still emits a **populated,
    all-0%** cobertura report: `coverageMap.Count > 0`, so fail-fast **trigger 2 does NOT fire** (it
    inspects `coverageMap.Count`, not hit counts — see **D-T14b**), no `contained no coverage data`
    message is printed, and the run exits **0 unless some member's CRAP > 8** (a genuinely uncovered
    high-CC member would still trip the exit-2 gate). The **behavior** of #10 is unchanged — the unit-only
    `--filter` is exactly as specified; only this rationale prose is corrected. (Ruled by Mr. Das:
    reverses the earlier "all tests / no `--filter`" stance; carry ONLY the `type!=IntegrationTests`
    clause.)

11. **Async/iterator coverage attribution (C#-specific)** — coverlet records a source async/iterator
    method's executable lines under its compiler-generated state-machine nested type
    `Outer/<Method>d__N` (on that type's `MoveNext`), NOT on the source method's own lines. crap4csharp
    now DETECTS a state-machine class — a nested last segment `<Method>d__N` with a **non-empty**
    `Method` (both `async` and `yield` iterators use the `d__` shape; the empty-bracket `<>c` /
    `<>c__DisplayClassN` lambda display classes are deliberately NOT matched) — demangles it to the
    enclosing type + `Method`, and **attributes the state machine's `MoveNext` line coverage** (MoveNext
    only; the synthetic `.ctor`/`SetStateMachine`/`Dispose` siblings carry no user source and are
    ignored) to the key `NormalizeTypeName(enclosingType) + "#" + Method + ":" + minMoveNextLine`.
    `CrapAnalyzer`'s existing exact->nearest-line lookup then resolves the source method (declared a few
    lines above its body) to this key with **no analyzer change**; overloaded async/iterator methods
    (multiple `<M>d__N`) disambiguate by nearest MoveNext min-line, exactly as regular overloads do.
    **Observable behavior:** async and iterator methods that ARE tested now report their REAL coverage
    and CRAP instead of `N/A`, so they participate in the exit-2 threshold gate (previously they always
    escaped it). Analog of departure #2 (a C#-ecosystem enrichment of the metric's inputs, faithful to
    crap4java's *intent* of scoring the human-authored method). Implements requirement-intent R3.
    **Scope is surgical:** ONLY `d__N` state machines (async + iterators). Lambdas (`<M>b__N`) and local
    functions (`<M>g__...|N`) remain compiler-generated-skipped — their coverage-consistency question is
    a known related gap, DEFERRED (finding #3). (Ruled by Mr. Das: FIX; attribute `<M>d__N` -> source
    async/iterator method; do NOT fold in lambdas/local functions.)

12. **Per-file coverage-key basename (C#-specific; no Java analog)** — the frozen reciprocal coverage
    key gains a source-file **basename** segment: `TypeName#method#Path.GetFileName(file):line` (the
    `:line` MIN-`@number` stays LAST for the reciprocal nearest-line lookup). A C# **partial class split
    across files** can declare overloads — and, post-T23, compiler-generated members — at overlapping
    min-lines; coverlet emits one `<class>` per file, so the pre-T24 `TypeName#method:line` key collided
    and the overloads borrowed each other's coverage through the nearest-line scan. The basename
    segregates the per-file entries. `NormalizeTypeName` and the frozen `TypeName` form are **unchanged**
    (the basename is a new, separate segment, not part of `TypeName`); both producers (`ReadClassMethods`
    + the T21 `ReadStateMachineMoveNext`) and the consumer (`CrapAnalyzer`) thread it identically, and a
    missing/empty `filename` yields an unmatchable `Type#method#:line` key → per-method `N/A`, never a
    mis-attribution. **Observable behavior:** overloads of a split partial class now report their OWN
    file's coverage instead of borrowing a sibling's. A C#-ecosystem correctness fix with no crap4java
    counterpart (Java has no partial classes). See the **T24 register** (D-T24a–g). (Ruled by Mr. Das:
    key format `TypeName#method#basename:line`.)

13. **Compiler-generated member coverage attribution (C#-specific)** — generalizes departure #11
    (which attributes only async/iterator `<Method>d__N` state machines) to **every** compiler-generated
    member the C# compiler lowers off a source method: lambdas (`<M>b__N`, hosted on the `<>c` static
    cache / `<>c__DisplayClassN` capturing closure), local functions (`<M>g__L|N`, hosted on the real
    class or, when captured, a display class), and async-locals (`<<M>g__...>d__N` / `<<M>b__...>d__N` —
    an async local function/lambda lowered onto its own state machine). crap4csharp DEMANGLES the source
    method `M` from each member name (`^<([^<>]+)>[bg]__`; a user method never contains angle brackets),
    ATTRIBUTES the member's own `<line>` coverage to
    `NormalizeTypeName(enclosingType) + "#" + M + "#" + basename + ":" + line`, and **UNIONs** it into
    that source method's coverage. Every physical source line belongs to exactly ONE coverlet `<method>`,
    so the body's lines and the synthetic member's lines are DISJOINT and summing `(missed, covered)` is
    a set union, never a double-count. Attribution is nearest-body (the same ordinal min-line scan
    `CrapAnalyzer` already runs for overloads), so a member folds into ITS OWN same-file overload and
    distinct overloads are never blended. A member `filename` that does not match the source method's
    file yields an unmatchable key → the method stays per-method `N/A` (departure #1 family, D-T24d) — a
    SAFE under-report, never a false pass: the source method's OWN body coverage still matches its OWN key,
    so only the ADDITIVE synthetic contribution is dropped and effective CRAP can only RISE (exit-2 gate
    MORE likely to fire) — unlike **D-T28a** / **#14 residual (b)**, where a producer/consumer NAME
    misalignment instead hid a present-in-coverage, uncovered, high-CC member and LOWERED the max-CRAP the
    gate sees (the opposite, unsafe direction). **Observable behavior:** never-invoked lambdas and local
    functions now report their REAL (possibly 0%) coverage and CRAP instead of `N/A`, so they participate
    in the exit-2 threshold gate (closes finding #3's false pass — a never-invoked local function now
    scores CRAP 2.0 at CC 1 / 0% rather than escaping it). Analog of departure #2 (a C#-ecosystem
    enrichment of the metric's inputs, faithful to crap4java's *intent* of scoring the human-authored
    method). Supersedes departure #11's now-stale "lambdas/local functions remain skipped — finding #3
    deferred" clause; #11's `d__N` async/iterator attribution is UNCHANGED — #13 only ADDS the other
    member shapes. See the **T23 register** (D-T23a–e). (Ruled by Mr. Das: attribute ALL
    compiler-generated members to `NormalizeTypeName(enclosing)#SourceMethod#basename:line`; nearest-body
    union; safe-`N/A` on filename mismatch.)

14. **Full executable-member decomposition (C#-ecosystem breadth; no crap4java analog)** — the T9
    parser (`CSharpMethodParser`), previously `MethodDeclarationSyntax`-only, now also emits descriptors
    + augmented CC + coverage attribution for **every logic-bearing member with a body**: property/
    indexer accessors (`get_`/`set_`/`init`→`set_`), user-defined operators (`op_*`, incl. C#-11
    `op_UnsignedRightShift`), conversion operators (`op_Implicit`/`op_Explicit`), finalizers (`~T` → CLR
    `Finalize`), and custom event accessors (`add_`/`remove_`). Keying is **CLR-name passthrough (b-1)**:
    the descriptor `Name` IS the CLR method name, used as BOTH the report `Method` column and the
    coverage-key `method` token (`init` accessors emit `set_<Id>`). Bodyless members are SKIPPED
    (auto/abstract accessors, field-like/auto event accessors, static-abstract/partial-defining
    operators). **Constructors stay excluded** (crap4java §8.1, unchanged). Coverage-side: the
    `IsCompilerGeneratedMethod` Rule-3 accessor skip is DELETED so `get_`/`set_`/`add_`/`remove_` entries
    emit like ordinary methods (`op_*`/`Finalize` already flowed through — no skip rule ever matched
    them); the frozen `TypeName#method#basename:line` key and `NormalizeTypeName` are **unchanged**, and
    `TypeNameOf` only widens its parameter `MethodDeclarationSyntax`→`SyntaxNode` with byte-identical
    output. Same class as departures #2/#11/#13 (a C#-ecosystem enrichment faithful to crap4java's
    *intent* of scoring human-authored logic), NOT a crap4java parity break (crap4java is method-only by
    construction). **Deferred/skipped:** C#-11 `op_Checked*` variants are SKIPPED — every checked
    operator must be declared alongside its non-checked sibling, which IS scored, so the operator KIND is
    covered; emitting the base name for the checked form would collide two same-CLR-name descriptors and
    risk a false pass (Anders design call under Mr. Das's delegation; reversible upgrade path recorded).
    **Documented residuals:** (a) *(never a false pass across DISTINCT members)* same-CLR-name
    conversions/indexers rely on basename + nearest-line and inherit the accepted overload-adjacency
    residual (D-T21c/D-T24g); (b) **[LITERAL case RESOLVED by T28 — see D-T28a; the "never a false pass"
    characterization of (b) was DISPROVEN.]** a LITERAL `[IndexerName("X")]` indexer now emits parser
    `get_X`/`set_X` and round-trips coverage; the residual `N/A` is narrowed to (i) a NON-LITERAL
    `[IndexerName(<const>)]` argument (not statically readable) and (ii) explicit-interface members whose
    CLR name does not match the coverage entry — and for (b) this is NOT "never a false pass": an uncovered
    high-CC member there degrades to `N/A`, is skipped by `MaxCrap`, and ESCAPES the exit-2 gate (a false
    negative). See the **T26 register** (D-T26a–g) and the **T28 register** (D-T28a–d). (Ruled by Mr. Das:
    MAXIMAL scope + both extras — finalizers + custom event accessors; b-1 CLR-name keying; (a) documented
    safe-`N/A`; (b) literal case RESOLVED at T28, non-literal/explicit-interface a documented gate-evasion
    residual.)

15. **Same-line-accessor coverlet-blind 0%-promotion (C#-ecosystem; coverlet #507; no crap4java
    analog)** — coverlet is **line-level** and records only the FIRST accessor on a shared physical source
    line, dropping the rest from the cobertura XML entirely (coverlet issue #507; **hit-independent, no
    config toggle exists**). So an emitted property/indexer/event accessor whose declaration **start line**
    equals an EARLIER accessor's of the same member is **structurally absent** from a populated report.
    The T9 parser now flags such an accessor `CoverletBlind` at parse — start line = the accessor KEYWORD
    line (identical to `Emit`'s `StartLine`), first-on-line wins, kind-agnostic
    (`get`/`set`/`init`/`add`/`remove`); auto/bodyless accessors never become descriptors (#14) so never
    blind, and single-accessor members (expression-bodied get-only property/indexer, every method/operator/
    conversion/finalizer) are never routed through the shared-line detection. Detection may safely
    OVER-flag (superset-safe): promotion is separately gated on genuine absence. The bit rides on a 2nd
    C#-only appended-last `MethodDescriptor` field (`bool CoverletBlind = false`, after `TypeName`);
    `MethodMetrics` is UNCHANGED (the bit is consumed inside `Analyze` before the metric is built). In
    `CrapAnalyzer`, a `CoverletBlind` descriptor that misses BOTH exact and nearest lookup (`coverage is
    null`) **AND** whose enclosing `TypeName#…#basename` is present in the populated map is scored **0.0%**
    — a real measurement (uninvoked within an instrumented type) — instead of `N/A`, so an uncalled
    **CC ≥ 3** same-line second accessor now yields CRAP ≥ 12, is picked up by `MaxCrap`, and trips the
    exit-2 gate it previously escaped. The **type-present guard** (`∃` map key `StartsWith(TypeName + "#",
    Ordinal)` && `Contains("#" + basename + ":", Ordinal)`) asserts the enclosing type WAS instrumented; it
    only suppresses the pathological "enclosing type entirely absent from a populated report" case (where
    `N/A` is correct — never fabricate 0% for an uninstrumented type, keeping within W4's spirit) and is
    always satisfied where it matters (the surviving first accessor is present under the same
    `TypeName`+`basename`). **Narrowly amends departure #1's per-method-`N/A` clause for exactly this
    shape**; every OTHER absent-from-populated-report member stays `N/A` — name-mangling residuals
    (explicit-interface, non-literal/foreign `[IndexerName]` — #14 residual (b) / D-T28a) and async/
    state-machine residuals are NOT coverlet-blind and are untouched, and multi-line accessors / finalizers
    / operators / standalone getters are still caught at real 0%. **Completes departure #14's promise**
    that every body-bearing member participates in the gate. **Accepted new false-FAIL (fail-closed, Mr.
    Das):** a COVERED same-line CC ≥ 3 second accessor is dropped by #507 **regardless of hits** →
    absent → promoted to 0% → false exit 2. Accepted: it needs the same rare same-line + CC ≥ 3
    construction as the escape it closes, PLUS the accessor actually being tested, and errs toward the
    gate firing (fail-closed). Same enrichment class as departures #2/#11/#13/#14 (a C#-ecosystem
    enrichment of the metric's inputs, faithful to crap4java's *intent* of scoring human-authored logic).
    See the **T30 register** (D-T30a–d). (Ruled by Mr. Das: FIX via option (vi) — same-line-accessor
    0%-promotion WITH the type-present guard INCLUDED.)

16. **Test-project auto-discovery (amends departure #9 stage (ii); C#-ecosystem)** — the
    `.Tests`/`.UnitTests` naming convention is **no longer required** for a target to be analyzable. Among
    the `.csproj` files under the invocation root (bin/obj excluded, #5) whose `ProjectReference`s
    transitively include the owning project, `TestProjectResolver` picks by **tier**: **(1)**
    `<Project>.Tests`/`<Project>.UnitTests` — no marker required, ordinal-first on a tie (the prior #9
    behavior, unchanged); **(2)** *marked* test projects named `<Project>.*` (e.g. `Foo.BlackBoxTests`,
    `Foo.Specs`); **(3)** any *marked* test project. The first non-empty tier wins; **>1 candidate at tier
    2 or 3 fail-fasts** with anchor **`Multiple test projects`** (exit 1, before any coverage run, listing
    the ordinal-sorted candidates) — never a guess. **Marked** = an **unconditioned**
    `<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>` or `<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk">` found
    in the `.csproj`, its bounded `Directory.Build.props`/`Directory.Build.targets` chain, or any file
    those `<Import>` (recursive, cycle-safe, bounded to the invocation root, `$(...)` expanded over the
    D-T29a property map with `MSBuildThisFile*` re-scoped to the importing file). Conditioned markers are
    ignored (fail-safe); an `<Import>`'s own Condition is not evaluated — it is followed iff the expanded
    path exists. **Motivation:** blackbox-first repos (in-process hosts such as `WebApplicationFactory`,
    or driving the entry point) rarely use the `.Tests` name; in-process blackbox tests produce Coverlet
    coverage exactly like unit tests. **Unchanged:** one owning project per run (#7/#9 span fail-fast),
    one test project per run, and departure **#10**'s `type!=IntegrationTests` filter (Gherkin/E2E suites
    tagged `IntegrationTests` stay excluded; untagged blackbox tests run). **Out of scope:** apps the tests
    launch out-of-process (Coverlet's collector cannot see them), a `--test-project` override. See the
    **T32 register**. (Ruled by Mr. Das: option A — convention first, then discovery; name-prefix tier;
    keep #10.)

## Cyclomatic complexity — authoritative node set

Base `CC = 1`. Walk the method `Body`/`ExpressionBody`; **descend into lambdas + local functions**;
**prune at nested type/enum declarations**. `+1` for each occurrence of:

- **Faithful (ported from crap4java):** `IfStatement`; `For`; `ForEach` (+ `ForEachVariable`);
  `While`; `Do`; `CatchClause`; `ConditionalExpression` (`?:`); `CaseSwitchLabel`;
  `CasePatternSwitchLabel`; `DefaultSwitchLabel`; `&&`; `||`.
- **Modern additions (approved):** `SwitchExpressionArm`; `??` (`CoalesceExpression`); `??=`
  (`CoalesceAssignmentExpression`); pattern `and` (`AndPattern`); pattern `or` (`OrPattern`);
  pattern `not` (`UnaryPattern`); `CatchFilterClause`; **every `when` guard** (`WhenClause` — all-when).
- **Not counted:** bare `else`; `try`/`finally`; jump statements (`return`/`break`/`continue`/`goto`/
  `throw`); `?.`/`?[]`; `is`-pattern without a combinator; bitwise `&`/`|`/`^`.

## Idiomatic policy

- **Adopt-now baseline (I-series):** nullable enable; `record` value types; `InvariantCulture` +
  `"\n"`; `XDocument` in the coverage adapter; async stdout drain; `IReadOnlyList` returns.
- **Greenlit follow-ons (after the faithful baseline is green):** O1 — `ExitCode` enum; O2 —
  subprocess timeout + cancellation.
- **Deferred (Mr. Das to decide later):** O3 — typed coverage lookup (reshapes parity tests); O4 —
  fraction-coverage (spec §10 wording); O5 — globbing discovery; O6 — `[Theory]` consolidation.
- **Declined:** `System.CommandLine` (breaks CLI contract), off-the-shelf CC metrics (breaks
  oracles), DI container, micro-optimizations.

## Test-parity note (fail-fast)

The single knowing parity break: ~4 `CliApplication`/`Program` coverage-path tests change from
"warn + `N/A` + exit 0" to fail-fast; **+2** new fail-fast tests. All other assertions are identical.

Separately, **departure #7 (resolve-once)** adapts crap4java's module-grouping tests to a single
resolve + single coverage run (or drops them) — no module-group-loop tests are ported (T11/T12/T14).

**T17/S5 (Model B, departures #9/#10).** `ModuleRootResolverTests` is renamed/reshaped to
`OwningProjectResolverTests` (bounded nearest-`.csproj`; the `.sln`-precedence cases are DROPPED — `.sln`
is no longer a marker); a new `TestProjectResolverTests` covers the `.Tests`/`.UnitTests` naming gate,
transitive/cycle-safe `ProjectReference` reachability, `bin`/`obj` + bounded-scope exclusion, and the
non-throwing missing/**malformed-existing** `.csproj` discipline (FLAG-1); `CliApplicationTests` gains
on-disk owning+test `.csproj` fixtures plus **+3** absence tests (`No owning .csproj`, `No test project`,
`span multiple projects`). `CoverageRunnerTests` is retargeted to the
`GenerateCoverage(testProject, coverageBaseDirectory)` signature and pins the unit-only `--filter` **token
pair**; the new `CoverageFilterBehaviorTests` spawns a REAL `dotnet test --filter "type!=IntegrationTests"`
to prove untagged RUNS + `type=IntegrationTests` EXCLUDED (departure #10). crap4java's module-grouping /
all-tests parity tests remain **ADAPTED** (resolve-once) or **DROPPED** — none assert running every module
test after #10.

## Environment adaptations (from nucleus)

- **Dropped as N/A for a CLI:** web-app liveness watch / `run-app` / `dev.ps1` / `session-startup`,
  dev-cert fix, bicep lint, dev secrets, business NuGet packages (MediatR/AutoMapper/etc.).
- **Kept & adapted:** `.editorconfig`; analyzers (NetAnalyzers, StyleCop, BannedApiAnalyzers);
  warnings-as-errors in Release; `global.json`; `nuget.config` (nuget.org only); the agentic loop
  files; `meta-design` + feature template; `retrospective` + `build-test` skills.
- **New:** GitHub Actions CI (nucleus used Azure DevOps).

## T31 register — .NET 8 → .NET 10 target-framework bump (`vibe/dotnet10-upgrade`)

Resolved decisions from the mechanical TFM retarget. **Supersedes** the original "TFM" locked choice
(`net8.0`; "SDKs 8/9/10 present; .NET 10 offers no conversion benefit"). **No new departure number** —
this is a build/tooling change, not a behavioral one; the CRAP algorithm, CLI contract, and analysis
semantics are unchanged.

- **D-T31a — trigger: the dev machine only has the .NET 10 SDK installed.** The prior locked choice
  assumed SDKs 8/9/10 were all present locally; that ceased to hold (`dotnet --list-sdks` → `10.0.400`
  only). Rather than requiring a machine-specific SDK 8 install to keep building this repo, `TargetFramework`
  is bumped to `net10.0` in **both** `src/Crap4CSharp/Crap4CSharp.csproj` and
  `tests/Crap4CSharp.Tests/Crap4CSharp.Tests.csproj`, and `global.json`'s `sdk.version` is bumped from
  `8.0.406` to the installed `10.0.400` (`rollForward` **kept** at `latestFeature`, not widened to
  `latestMajor` — the original policy's intent, pin-to-a-feature-band-with-forward-roll-within-it, is
  preserved verbatim at the new major version, not loosened as a workaround).
- **D-T31b — package versions held, not bulk-bumped.** `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` (4.14.0),
  `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` (9.0.0), `StyleCop.Analyzers` (1.2.0-beta.556),
  `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.BannedApiAnalyzers` (3.3.4), `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` (17.8.0), `xunit`
  (2.5.3), `xunit.runner.visualstudio` (2.5.3), `xunit.analyzers` (1.15.0), `FluentAssertions` (kept
  pinned `[7.0.0,8.0.0)` — the Apache-2.0 license pin is unaffected by the TFM bump and was **not**
  touched), `FluentAssertions.Analyzers` (0.34.1), `coverlet.collector` (6.0.0) all build and run clean
  on `net10.0` at their existing pinned versions; `dotnet list package --outdated` shows newer majors
  exist for several of these (e.g. `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` 10.0.401,
  `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` 18.10.1) but bumping analyzer/test-SDK majors is a separate, higher-risk
  change (new analyzer rule surfaces, breaking test-SDK changes) out of scope for a mechanical TFM
  retarget — deferred, not required here.
- **D-T31c — both `packages.lock.json` files regenerated via `dotnet restore --force-evaluate`,** not
  hand-edited and not left to drift as a side effect of an unrelated restore. `RestorePackagesWithLockFile`
  (Common.targets) still governs both.
- **D-T31d — the `CoverageFilterBehaviorTests` fixture template was also net8.0-pinned and needed the
  same bump.** The real-`dotnet test`-spawning fixture project embedded as a C# string literal in
  `tests/Crap4CSharp.Tests/CoverageFilterBehaviorTests.cs` (`FixtureProject` constant, isolated in a temp
  dir outside the repo) hardcoded `<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>`; this is invisible to a
  `.csproj`-only grep for the TFM but broke the test at run time (`testhost` for net8.0 has no matching
  runtime once only the net10 runtime is installed: "You must install or update .NET to run this
  application"). Bumped to `net10.0` alongside its package versions (already Test.Sdk
  17.8.0/xunit 2.5.3/xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.5.3, held per D-T31b — those install fine on net10). Full
  suite is 216/216 green after this fix; it was the only failure the retarget surfaced.
- **Verification:** `dotnet build crap4csharp.sln --configuration Release` — 0 errors, 0 warnings
  (warnings-as-errors/`AnalysisLevel=latest-all` clean, no new net10-analyzer warnings surfaced).
  `dotnet test` — 216/216 passed. CLI smoke-tested end-to-end against a real external target
  (`/Users/rex/dev/uml-viewer-dotnet/src/UmlViewer.Core`, explicit `.cs` file list, run from that repo's
  own directory so `OwningProjectResolver`'s bounded upward search finds its `.csproj`) — real coverage
  run completed, report printed, exit 0.

## T32 register — test-project auto-discovery; adds departure #16 (`vibe/test-project-auto-discovery`)

- **D-T32a — result record, not a nullable path.** `ResolveTestProject` returns
  `TestProjectResolution(string? TestProject, IReadOnlyList<string> AmbiguousCandidates)` (same shape
  as `OwningProjectResolution`) so `CliApplication.Execute` can distinguish *none* (`No test project`)
  from *ambiguous* (`Multiple test projects`), and owns both exits (D-T14a).
- **D-T32b — reference filter now runs before the name filter.** Every non-bin/obj `.csproj` under the
  root is checked for transitive reachability (memoized per call), then tiered. Marker evaluation runs
  only on reachable candidates and only when tier 1 is empty, so repos already on the convention pay no
  marker cost.
- **D-T32c — tier 1 keeps ordinal-first; tiers 2/3 fail-fast.** Preserves the exact pre-#16 behavior
  (and `PicksOrdinalFirstWhenMultipleQualify`) for convention-named repos; discovery, being heuristic,
  never guesses between candidates.
- **Verification:** `dotnet test` — 232/232 passed, 0 warnings.
